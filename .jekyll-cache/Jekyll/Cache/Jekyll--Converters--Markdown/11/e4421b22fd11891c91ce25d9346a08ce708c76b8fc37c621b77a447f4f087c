    <p>It was the evening before; on leaving the bar he had an impression that his groin was swollen and he had pains in his armpits when he moved his arms. “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="I’m in for it - (guaranteed to get or have)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(肯定会经历/注定遭受)</code></b>!” he thought.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps because I, too, would like to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="do my bit"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(尽微薄之力)</code></b> for happiness.</p>
  </li>

    <p>During that fortnight Rambert worked <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="incapable of being fatigued \ ˌin-di-ˈfa-ti-gə-bəl \"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">indefatigably</code></b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="giving every ounce of himself"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(用[最后]全部的勇气/精力/力量等)</code></b>, with his eyes shut, as it were, from dawn till night.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On returning home and failing to discover any symptoms of plague on his body, he had felt far from proud of having <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="given way"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________([尤指]在很大的压力下坍塌/垮掉)</code></b> like that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They’d <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="fix up - (to make arrangements for something)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(安排)</code></b> the final details in the course of the night, and he could count on them to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="see it through"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________([艰难地]坚持做完)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rieux shook his head with his usual <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="审慎"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deliberateness</code></b>. It was none of his business, he said. Rambert had elected for happiness, and he, Rieux, had no argument to put up against him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She was a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="年老干瘪的"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dried-up</code></b> little wisp of a woman, always dressed in black, busy as a bee, and she had a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="深棕色的"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nut-brown</code></b>, wrinkled face and immaculately white hair.<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="No great talker"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(话不多)</code></b>, she merely smiled genially when her eyes fell on Rambert.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next day was very hot and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="\ ˈmə-gē \ being warm, damp, and close"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">muggy</code></b> and a heat-mist veiled the sun. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="The total of deaths had jumped up"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(死亡人数飙升)</code></b>. But the old Spanish woman lost nothing of her serenity. “There’s so much wickedness in the world,” she said. “So what can you expect?”</p>
