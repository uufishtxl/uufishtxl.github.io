    <p>He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="gave the credit - (to sth)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å½’åŠŸäº)</code></b> of this to Dr. Castelâ€™s new serum, which, indeed, had brought off some quite unlooked-for recoveries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The walls served another purpose: they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="screened"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä¿æŠ¤/é®æ©/é®è”½)</code></b> the unfortunates in quarantine from the view of people on the road.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result was that poor families were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in great straits - (strait - a situation of perplexity or distress)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ç»æµçª˜è¿«)</code></b>, while the rich <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="went short of - (go/run short of)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ç¼º/ä¸è¶³)</code></b> practically nothing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poor people who were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="feeling the pinch"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________([å°¤æŒ‡å› èµšé’±ä¸å¦‚ä»¥å‰å¤šè€Œ]æ„Ÿåˆ°æ‹®æ®)</code></b> thought still more nostalgically of towns and villages in the near-by countryside, where bread was cheap and life without restrictions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the actual number of deaths showed no increase. But it seemed that plague had settled in for good <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="at its most virulent - (at your best/worst/most effective etc. - å¤„äºæœ€ä½³/æœ€å·®/æœ€æœ‰æ•ˆçš„çŠ¶æ€)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å¤„äºæœ€è‡´å‘½çš„çŠ¶æ€)</code></b>, and it took its daily toll of deaths with the punctual zeal of a good civil servant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authorities, who had long been desirous of giving a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="\ Ëˆfi-lÉ™p \ STIMULUS"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fillip</code></b> to the morale of the populace, but had so far been prevented by the plague from doing so, now proposed to convene a meeting of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="the medical corps - (corps - å¸¸è§ä¹‰ä¸ºç‰¹ç§éƒ¨é˜Ÿ/ç‰¹æ®Šå…µç§ï¼Œæ–‡ä¸­æ„æ€ä¸ºä¸€ç¾¤äºº/ä¸€ç»„äºº)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(åŒ»ç–—äººå‘˜)</code></b> and ask for an announcement on the subject.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this regrettable event, which, sensational as it was, actually proved nothing, was to make our authorities <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="swing back to"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(é‡æ–°å›åˆ°æŸç§çŠ¶æ€)</code></b> pessimism as inconsequently as they had previously indulged in optimism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one was to believe what one read in them, our populace was giving â€œa fine exampleâ€ of courage and composure. But in a town <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="thrown back upon"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä½¿ä¾èµ–/ä½¿ä¾é )</code></b> itself, in which nothing could be kept secret, no one had illusions about the â€œexampleâ€ given by the public.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against this advantage may be set the fact that the inmates could hear all day, though they could not see them, the passing streetcars, and recognize by the increased volume of sound coming from the road the hours when people had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="knocked off work"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æ•²è½å·¥ä½œï¼Œæ­‡å·¥ï¼Œè¿™é‡Œæ˜¯ä¸‹ç­çš„æ„æ€)</code></b> or were going to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, just before the meeting was due to take place, Dr. Richard, too, was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="carried off"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä½¿ä¸§å‘½)</code></b> by the plague, then precisely at â€œhigh-water mark.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theoretically, and in the view of the authorities, this was a hopeful sign. The fact that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="the graph after its long rising curve had flattened out"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(åœ¨ä¸€ç›´å‡é«˜åï¼Œæ›²çº¿å¼€å§‹è¶‹äºå¹³ç¨³)</code></b> seemed to many, Dr. Richard for example, reassuring. â€œThe graphâ€™s good today,â€ he would remark, rubbing his hands.</p>
