<p>Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, youâ€™ll land among the stars.</p>

<p>The more intensely we feel about an idea or a goal, the more asuuredly the idea, buried deep in our subsconcious, will (è½») direct us along the path (é‡) to its fullfillment.</p>

<p>A dream should never be evaluated according to its size. Thatâ€™s not what determines its worth. A dream doesnâ€™t have to be big. It just has to be bigger than you are.</p>

<p>Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail(é™) what you resolve.</p>

<p>Within our dreams and aspirations we find our opportunities.</p>

<p>Every man, however wise, needs the advice of some sagacious friend in the affairs of life.</p>

<p>Fear melts when you take action towards goal your really want.</p>

<p>Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.</p>

<p>Nobody gets to live life backward. Look ahead, that(é‡éŸ³+åœé¡¿) is where your future(è¿™ä¸ªä¸»è¯­æ²¡ä¸Šå‡è¯­è°ƒ) lies.</p>

<p>Cease negative mental chattering. - If you think a thing is impossible, youâ€™ll make it impossible. Pessimism é™ blunts the tools é™you need to succeed.</p>

<p>The successful man é™ will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way.</p>

<p>It is the nature of man to rise to greatness if greatness is expected of him.</p>

<p>Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.</p>
