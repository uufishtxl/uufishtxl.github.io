    <p>â€œThis particular tobacconist â€“ a woman, by the way,â€ Grand explained, â€œis a holy <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="terror"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è®¨åŒé¬¼)</code></b>.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I told Cottard so, but he replied that I was prejudiced and she had plenty of good <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="points"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ç‰¹ç‚¹/ç‰¹æ€§/ç‰¹å¾)</code></b>, only one had to find them out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now the only Oran newspaper he bought was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="the conservative organ - (organ - å…šæŠ¥)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä¿å®ˆå…šçš„æœºå…³æŠ¥)</code></b>, and one could hardly help suspecting that he made a point of reading it in public places.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He paused; with a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="machine-gun"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æœºå…³æª)</code></b> rattle from its <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="exhaust"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æ’æ°”ç³»ç»Ÿ)</code></b> the â€œderatizationâ€ van was clattering by.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since his attempt at suicide Cottard had had no more visitors. In the streets, in shops, he was always trying to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="strike up friendships - (strike up - å¼€å§‹[äº¤è°ˆ]/å»ºç«‹[å‹è°Š]/å¼€å§‹[æ¥å¾€])"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å»ºç«‹å‹è°Š)</code></b>. To the grocer he was all affability; no one could take more pains than he to show his interest in the tobacconistâ€™s gossip.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="his humor had its ups and downs"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä»–çš„æƒ…ç»ªæ—¶å¥½æ—¶å)</code></b>. One day when the grocer had shown less affability, he came home <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in a tearing rage"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æ€’ä¸å¯é)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>â€œI donâ€™t quite know how to put it, but I must say Iâ€™ve an impression that he is trying to make himself agreeable to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="all and sundry - (sundry - including many things of different kinds)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æ‰€æœ‰äºº)</code></b>, to be <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in everybodyâ€™s good books"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å—åˆ°æ‰€æœ‰äººçš„æ¬¢è¿)</code></b>.</p>

  <li>
    <p><b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="An animated conversation"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å…´è‡´å‹ƒå‹ƒçš„äº¤è°ˆ)</code></b> was in progress and the woman behind the counter started <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="airing her views - (air - to express publicly)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å¤¸å¤¸å…¶è°ˆ)</code></b> about a murder case that had created some stir in Algiers. A young commercial employee had killed an Arabian on a beach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently Grand reported to the doctor other changes in Cottardâ€™s character. Cottard had always professed very liberal ideas, as his <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="pet"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(é’Ÿçˆ±çš„/å–œçˆ±çš„)</code></b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="æ ¼è¨€ \ Ëˆdik-tÉ™m \"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dictum</code></b> on economic questions, â€œBig fish eat little fish,â€ implied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not long after this he made some curious remarks to Grand in the course of conversation. He had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="badgered Grand into - (doing something; badger åŸæ„æ˜¯ç¾)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ç¼ ç€Grandï¼Œè®©ä»–åšæŸäº‹)</code></b> telling him about the somewhat mysterious â€œprivate workâ€ to which Grand gave his evenings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grand noticed that the staff <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="made much of"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(é‡è§†/ç†è§£)</code></b> Cottard and he soon discovered why, when he saw the lavish tips his companion gave. The traveling salesman seemed greatly to appreciate the amiability shown him in return for his <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="\ lÃ¤r-Ëˆzhes \ GENEROSITY"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">largesse</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>â€œHeâ€™s a man with something pretty serious <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="on his conscience"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å¿ƒäº‹é‡é‡çš„ - weighing heavily and guiltily on one's mind)</code></b>,â€ Grand said gravely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somewhat <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="of the same order"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(åŒæ•°é‡çº§çš„)</code></b> was a request he made to Grand shortly before he left his sick-bed; Grand mentioned he was going to the post office and Cottard asked him to be kind enough to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="dispatch a money order"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å‘å‡ºæ±‡ç¥¨)</code></b> for a hundred francs to a sister living at a distance, mentioning that he sent her this sum every month.</p>
