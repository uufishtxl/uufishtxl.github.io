    <p>Yes, an element of abstraction, of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a divorce from reality"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(与现实的分离)</code></b>, entered into such calamities. Still when abstraction <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="sets to - (doing something)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(开始做某事)</code></b> killing you, you’ve got to get busy with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And so much Rieux knew: that this wasn’t the easiest <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="course"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(行为/做法)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Please don’t doubt I understand you,” Rieux said, “but you must see your argument doesn’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="hold water"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________([论点或理论]符合逻辑/站得住脚)</code></b>. I can’t give you that certificate because I don’t know whether you have the disease or not.”</p>

    <p>Rieux asked him to let him know how he got on with his project, and not to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="bear him a grudge"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(心怀怨恨)</code></b> for not having been more amenable. He was sure, he added, that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="there was some common ground on which they could meet"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(在某些方面他们是能够达成一致的)</code></b>. Rambert looked perplexed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Because there are thousands of people <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="placed as you"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(有着和你一样的处境)</code></b> are in this town, and there can’t be any question of allowing them to leave it.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But was he right in reproaching him, Rieux, with living in a world of abstractions? Could that term “abstraction” really apply to these days he spent in his hospital while the plague was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="battening on"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(靠别人养肥自己[贬义])</code></b> the town, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="raising its death-toll to five hundred victims"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(将死亡人数提升至500)</code></b> a week?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The journalist <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="tugged at his tie to straighten it"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(拉紧领带)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rieux was silent for a moment, then said he understood it perfectly. He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="wished nothing better than"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(非常希望某事发生)</code></b> that Rambert should be allowed to return to his wife and that all who loved one another and were parted should come together again.</p>
