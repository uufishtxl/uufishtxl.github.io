    <p>On the other side, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="spanning some streets"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(越过几条街)</code></b> and the unseen harbor, their gaze came to rest on the horizon, where <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="sea and sky merged in a dim, vibrant grayness"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(海天一线，汇成了一片模糊又不断起伏的灰白色)</code></b>.</p>

    <p>“A pleasant spot,” said Rieux as he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="lowered himself into a chair"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(坐到椅子上)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“I brought off everything I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="set my hand to"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(着手/参与)</code></b>, I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="moved at ease in the field of the intellect"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(才华出众)</code></b>, I got on excellently with women, and if I had occasional qualms, they passed as lightly as they came.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“In short, he wasn’t at all <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="original"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(特立独行)</code></b> and, now he’s dead, I realize that, while <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="no plaster saint"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(不是什么伪君子)</code></b>, he was a very decent man <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="as men go"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(人能成为的样子)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="kept the middle way"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(介于中间地带/两者之间)</code></b>, that’s all; he was the type of man for whom one has an affection of the mild but steady order—which is the kind that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="wears best - (wear well - 耐磨/经久耐用)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(经久不衰)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Could you tell me <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="即时/不做准备"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offhand</code></b> how to get from Briançon to Chamonix? Even a stationmaster would scratch his head, I should say. Well, my father <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="had the answer pat - (A pat answer or remark has been previously prepared, so that it is said quickly and without any real thought)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(立即回答)</code></b>. Almost every evening he enlarged his knowledge of the subject, and he prided himself on it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“He wasn’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a model husband"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(一位模范丈夫)</code></b>. I know that now, but I can’t say it shocks me particularly. Even in his infidelities he behaved as one could count on his behaving and never gave rise to scandal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that could be seen of him was a dark, bulky form outlined against the glimmering sky. He had much to tell; <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="what follows gives it more or less in his own words"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(下面是他所说的大概内容)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, settling into the chair beside Rieux, he fixed his eyes on his face. Three times the glow spread up the sky and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="died away"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(减弱/消失)</code></b>. A faint clatter of crockery rose from a room opening on the street below. A door banged somewhere in the house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They found nobody on the terrace—only three empty chairs. On one side, as far as eye could reach, was a row of terraces, the most remote of which <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="abut \ ə-ˈbət \ to border on"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abutted</code></b> on <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a dark, rugged mass - (mass - EXPANSE, BULK)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(一团黑漆漆、崎岖的物体)</code></b> that they recognized as the hill nearest the town.</p>
