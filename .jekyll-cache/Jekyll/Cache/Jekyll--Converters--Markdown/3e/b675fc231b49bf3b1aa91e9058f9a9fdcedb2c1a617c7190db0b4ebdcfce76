    <p>Besides the comforts sent by air or overland, compassionate or admiring comments were lavished on the henceforth isolated town, by way of newspaper articles or broadcast talks. And invariably their epical or prize-speech verbiage <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="jarred"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(使感到不快/使吃惊)</code></b> on the doctor.</p>

    <p>Rambert fought to prevent the plague from <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="besting"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(打败/胜过)</code></b> him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once assured that there was no way of getting out of the town by lawful methods, he decided, as he told Rieux, to have recourse to others. He began by <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="sounding"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(试探[某人的意见或感受])</code></b> café waiters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth was that Cottard, who had been beginning to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="live above his means"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(入不敷出)</code></b>, was now involved in smuggling ventures concerned with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="rationed goods"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(配给物品)</code></b>. Selling contraband cigarettes and inferior liquor at steadily rising prices, he was on the way to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="building up a small fortune"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(发一笔小财)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that day he and Rieux had been talking again about his unsuccessful efforts to interest the authorities in his case, and Cottard heard <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="the tail end"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(尾声/末尾)</code></b> of the conversation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some days later Cottard met him in the street and greeted him with the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="hail-fellow-well-met"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(非常友好地)</code></b> manner that he now used on all occasions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“It’s no good counting on the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="red-tape"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(繁文缛节/官僚习气)</code></b> merchants. They couldn’t understand if they tried.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, as it so happens, what has yet to be recorded before coming to the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="culmination"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(顶点/高潮)</code></b>, during the period when the plague was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="gathering all its forces"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(聚集全部力量)</code></b> to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="fling them at the town"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(猛扑整座市镇)</code></b> and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="lay it waste - (lay waste - 完全摧毁)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(将它完全摧毁)</code></b>, is the long, heartrendingly monotonous struggle put up by some obstinate people like Rambert to recover their lost happiness and to balk the plague of that part of themselves which they were ready to defend <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in the last ditch"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________([英勇战斗]到最后)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one of the cafés he visited he was actually taken for a stoolpigeon and curtly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="sent about his business"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(被打发去办事)</code></b>. It was not until he happened to meet Cottard at Rieux’s place that he made a little headway.</p>
