    <p>Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="allowed"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(承认)</code></b> her to be pretty, he had looked at her without admiration at the ball, and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her performance was pleasing, though by no means <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="capital"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(顶好的)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mary had neither genius nor taste, and though <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="vanity had given her application"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(虚荣心促使她勤学苦练)</code></b>, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="agree with"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(适宜)</code></b> Lady Lucas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="oblige"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(帮忙/效劳)</code></b> us for one half hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are a very strange creature <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="by way of"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(用作/作为)</code></b> a friend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="rendered uncommonly intelligent"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(使变得极其聪慧)</code></b> by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="failure"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(瑕疵)</code></b> of perfect symmetry in her <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="form"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(身条)</code></b>, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing, and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="fashionable world"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(有风度的上流社会)</code></b>, he was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="caught"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(吸引)</code></b> by the easy playfulness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="defied her friend to"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(挑动她的朋友做某事)</code></b> mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, “Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?”</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="purchase | OBSOLETE"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(获得)</code></b> praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs.</p>

    <p>Certainly, sir, and it had the advantage also of being <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in vogue"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(流行)</code></b> amongst the less polished societies of the world.</p>
