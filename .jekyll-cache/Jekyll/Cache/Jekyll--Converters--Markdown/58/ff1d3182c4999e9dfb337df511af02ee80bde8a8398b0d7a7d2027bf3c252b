    <p>The instructions began with a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="bald"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(èµ¤è£¸è£¸çš„/ç›´æˆªäº†å½“çš„)</code></b> statement that a few cases of a malignant fever had been reported in Oran; it was not possible as yet to say if this fever was contagious.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="This being so"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è¿™æ ·ä¸€æ¥)</code></b>, the Prefect felt no doubt that everybody <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in his jurisdiction"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(åœ¨ä»–çš„è¾–åŒºå†…)</code></b> would wholeheartedly second his personal efforts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The notice outlined the general program that the authorities had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="drawn up"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(èµ·è‰)</code></b>. It included a systematic extermination of the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="rat population"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è€é¼ æ•°é‡)</code></b> by injecting poison gas into the sewers, and a strict supervision of the water-supply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>â€œYour view, I take it,â€ the Prefect put in, â€œis this. Even if it isnâ€™t plague, the prophylactic measures <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="enjoined"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å‘½ä»¤/ä¿ƒä½¿)</code></b>by law for coping with a state of plague should be put into force immediately?â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter to me,â€ Rieux said, â€œhow you phrase it. My point is that we should not act as if <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="there were no likelihood"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ç»æ— å¯èƒ½å‘ç”ŸæŸäº‹)</code></b> that half the population would be wiped out; for then it would be.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="This way of putting it"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è¿™ç§å¤„ç½®æ–¹å¼)</code></b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="met with general approval"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è·å¾—äº†å¤§å¤šæ•°äººçš„åŒæ„)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was hard to find in these notices any indication that the authorities were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="facing the situation squarely"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æ˜ç¡®åº”å¯¹å½“å‰çš„æƒ…å†µ)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the day after the committee meeting the fever <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="notched another small advance - (notch \ ËˆnÃ¤ch \ SCORE, ACHIEVE )"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è·å¾—äº†å¦ä¸€ä¸ªå°è¿›å±•)</code></b>. It even found its way into the papers, but discreetly; only a few brief references to it were made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the following day, however, Rieux observed that small official <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="notices had been just put up"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å·²ç»å¼ è´´äº†å‘Šç¤º)</code></b> about the town, though in places where they would not attract much attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="None the less"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å°½ç®¡å¦‚æ­¤)</code></b>, guided by a spirit of prudence that all would appreciate, the Prefect was putting into force some precautionary measures. If these measures were carefully studied and properly applied, they would obviate any risk of an epidemic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also heads of households were ordered promptly to report any fever case diagnosed by their doctors and to permit the isolation of sick members of their families in special wards at the hospital. These wards, it was explained, were equipped to provide patients with immediate treatment and ensure the maximum <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="prospect of recovery"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æ²»æ„ˆçš„å¸Œæœ›)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the rest, the Prefect <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="confined himself to - (doing something)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(é™åˆ¶äºåšæŸäº‹)</code></b> advising all who had been in contact with the patient to consult the sanitary inspector and strictly to follow his advice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr. Rieux <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="swung round"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(çªç„¶è½¬èº«)</code></b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="brusque \ ËˆbrÉ™sk \ markedly short and abrupt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brusquely</code></b> from the poster and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="started back"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(çªç„¶é€€ç¼©/åŠ¨èº«è¿”å›)</code></b> to his surgery. Grand, who was awaiting him there, raised his arms dramatically when the doctor entered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the thing that had struck him most about the man was his aloofness, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="not to say"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è™½ç„¶è¯´ä¸ä¸Š)</code></b> his mistrust of everyone he met.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes in the evening he would go to a movie <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="across the way"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è¡—å¯¹é¢)</code></b>. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="In this connection - (with reference to the specified matter)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(åœ¨è¿™ä¸€ç‚¹ä¸Š)</code></b> Grand mentioned a detail he had noticedâ€”that Cottard seemed to have a preference for <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="gangster films"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è­¦åŒªç‰‡)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But Cottard was a silent, secretive man, with something about him that made Grand think of a wild boar. His bedroom, meals at a cheap restaurant, some rather mysterious comings and goingsâ€”<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="these were the sum of Cottardâ€™s days"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è¿™äº›äº‹å°±æ˜¯Cottardä¸€å¤©çš„å…¨éƒ¨æ´»åŠ¨)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
