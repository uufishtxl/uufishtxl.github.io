    <p>…bent as they were on cherishing the all-too-real phantoms of their imagination and conjuring up with all their might pictures of a land where <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a special play of light"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(一种特别的光束的闪烁)</code></b>, two or three hills, a favorite tree, a woman’s smile, composed for them a world that nothing could replace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What first <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="brought these home to them - (e.x - brought home to me the pointlessness of this war)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(使他们完全意识到)</code></b> was the trouble they experienced in summoning up any clear picture of what the absent one was doing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hostile to the past, impatient of the present, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="cheated of the future"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(对未来感到失望)</code></b>, we were much like those whom men’s justice, or hatred, forces to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="live behind prison bars"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(在铁窗中度日)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="fed"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(加深/加强)</code></b> their despondency with fleeting intimations, messages as disconcerting as a flight of swallows, a dew-fall at sundown, or those queer <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a tiny bright flash of light"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glints</code></b> the sun sometimes dapples on empty streets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, they forced themselves never to think about the problematic day of escape, to cease <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="looking to the future"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(期待未来)</code></b>, and always to keep, so to speak, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="their eyes fixed on the ground at their feet"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(一直低垂着眼睛过日子)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when they had drunk in advance the dregs of bitterness of those six black months, and painfully screwed up their courage to the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="sticking-place"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(顶点)</code></b>, straining all their remaining energy to endure valiantly the long ordeal of all those weeks and days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in a middle course between these heights and depths, they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="acquired substance"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(汲取到力量)</code></b> only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress.</p>
  </li>
