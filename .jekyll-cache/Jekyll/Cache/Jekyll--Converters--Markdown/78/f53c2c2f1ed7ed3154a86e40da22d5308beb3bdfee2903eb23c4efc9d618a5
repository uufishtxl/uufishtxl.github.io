    <p>Naturally enough, since <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="love asks something of the future"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(çˆ±è¦æ±‚çš„ä¸€äº›ä¸œè¥¿æºè‡ªäºæœªæ¥)</code></b>, and nothing was left us but a series of present moments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To assume this would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="fall somewhat short of the truth"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ææ€•ä¸äº‹å®ä¸ç¬¦)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be more correct to say that they were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="wasting away"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å˜æ¶ˆç˜¦/å˜è¡°å¼±)</code></b> emotionally as well as physically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our fellow citizens had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="fallen into line"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(éµå¾ª/é¡ºä»)</code></b>, adapted themselves, as people say, to the situation, because there was no way of doing otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without memories, without hope, they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="lived for the moment"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æ´»åœ¨å½“ä¸‹)</code></b> only.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, it may be said <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in passing"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(é¡ºå¸¦/é¡ºä¾¿ [è¿™é‡Œæ˜¯é¡ºå¸¦ä¸€æçš„æ„æ€])</code></b>, is why, so as not to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="play false to the facts - (play false - æ¬ºéª—/ä½œå‡)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æ¬ºç’çœŸç›¸)</code></b>, and, still more, so as not to play false to himself, the narrator has aimed at objectivity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in deference to"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å¤„äºå°Šé‡/è€ƒè™‘åˆ°)</code></b> this scruple he is constrained to admit that, though the chief source of distress, the deepest as well as the most widespread, was separation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But though they could clearly recall the face, the smile and voice of the beloved, and this or that occasion when (as they now <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="saw in retrospect"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å›å¿†èµ·)</code></b>) they had been supremely happyâ€¦</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And by the end of their long <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="\ ËˆsÉ™n-dÉ™r \ to break apart or in two"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sundering</code></b> they had also lost the power of imagining the intimacy that once was theirs or understanding what it can be to live with someone whose life is <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="åŒ…å«/åŒ…æ‹¬/ä½œä¸º...çš„ä¸€éƒ¨åˆ†"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapped up in</code></b> yours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who had jobs went about them <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="at the exact tempo"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä»¥...ä¸€è‡´çš„æ­¥è°ƒ/æ‹å­)</code></b> of the plague, with dreary perseverance. Everyone was modest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hitherto those who were parted had not been utterly unhappy; there was always a gleam of hope in the night of their distress; but that gleam had now <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="died out"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ç­ç»/æ¶ˆå¤±)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, while during the first weeks they were apt to complain that only shadows remained to them of what their love had been and meant, they now came to learn that even shadows can <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="waste away"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è¡°å¼±/æ¶ˆç˜¦/æ¶ˆé€€)</code></b>, losing the faint hues of life that memory may give.</p>
