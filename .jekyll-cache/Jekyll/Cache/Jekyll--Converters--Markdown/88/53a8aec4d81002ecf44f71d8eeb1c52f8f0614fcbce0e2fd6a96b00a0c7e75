    <p>Cottard was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a queer bird"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(一个古怪的人)</code></b>. For a long while their relations went no farther than wishing each other good-day when they met on the stairs.</p>

    <p>Grand had then explained to him that he was trying to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="brush up"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(重温/复习)</code></b> his Latin. He’d learned it at school, of course, but his memories had grown blurred.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rieux gazed down at him for a moment, then assured him that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="there was no question of"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________([某事]是不可能的)</code></b> anything like that, and in any case he was here to protect his patient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“As you can guess, we’ve other things to think about, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="what with - (used to talk about the reasons for a particular situation, especially a bad or difficult situation)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(因为...由于...)</code></b> this fever everybody’s thinking about.”</p>

  <li>
    <p>Grand, too, looked tired and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="\ ˌō-vər-ˈrȯt , ˌō-və- \ extremely excited"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">overwrought</code></b>; he kept <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="pacing up and down the room"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(在房间里来回走)</code></b>, opening and closing a portfolio crammed with sheets of manuscript that lay on the table.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inspector then asked him peremptorily if he intended to “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="have another go at it"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(再次尝试做这件事)</code></b>.” <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="Showing more animation"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(激动起来)</code></b>, Cottard said certainly not, his one wish was to be left in peace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt it was the weather. As the day <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="wore on"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(流逝)</code></b>, everything grew <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="sticky to the touch - (to the touch - 摸起来有...的触感; sticky 这里是棘手的意思)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(棘手)</code></b>, and Rieux felt his anxiety increasing after each visit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Allow me to point out, my man,” the police officer rejoined with asperity, “that just now it’s you who’re troubling the peace of others.” Rieux signed to him not to continue, and he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="left it at that"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(停止争论)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cottard replied that all this was quite needless, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="to his thinking"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(在他看来)</code></b>, and anyhow he didn’t like the police.</p>
