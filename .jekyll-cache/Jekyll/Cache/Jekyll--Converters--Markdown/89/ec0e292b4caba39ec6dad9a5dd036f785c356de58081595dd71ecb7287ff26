    <p>A burst of sunshine was enough to make them seem delighted with the world, while rainy days <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="gave a dark cast to"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(让...显得阴云密布)</code></b> their faces and their mood.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless—and this point is most important—however bitter their distress and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="however heavy their hearts"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(无论他们的内心是多么沉重)</code></b>, for all their emptiness, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="it can be truly said of these exiles - (后面 that + 从句)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(可以就流放一事这么说...)</code></b> that in the early period of the plague they could <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="account themselves privileged"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(认为自己是幸运的了)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And then <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="it dawned on him"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(他明白过来)</code></b> that he and the man with him were talking about the same thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether friendly or hostile, the reply always <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="missed fire"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(未达到预期的目标)</code></b>, and the attempt to communicate had to be given up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in these cases, too, even the sincerest grief had to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="make do with"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(凑合/将就着用)</code></b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="the set phrases"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(刻板话语)</code></b> of ordinary conversation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For while he himself spoke from the depths of long days of brooding upon his personal distress, and the image he had tried to impart had been slowly shaped and proved in the fires of passion and regret, this meant nothing to the man to whom he was speaking, who pictured a conventional emotion, a grief that is traded on the marketplace, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="mass-produced"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(司空见惯的)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was true of those at least for whom silence was unbearable, and since the others could not find the truly expressive word, they resigned themselves to using <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="the current coin of language - (current coin - 是货币的意思，这里也是一种比喻)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(极为平常的语言)</code></b>, the commonplaces of plain narrative, of anecdote, and of their daily paper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus in the very heart of the epidemic they maintained a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="saving"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(保留的)</code></b> indifference, which one was tempted to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="take for"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(认为)</code></b> composure.</p>
  </li>
