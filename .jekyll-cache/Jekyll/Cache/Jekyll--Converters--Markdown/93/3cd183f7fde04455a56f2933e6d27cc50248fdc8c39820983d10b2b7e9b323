    <p>As a result of the fighting at the gates, in the course of which the police had had to use their revolvers, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a spirit of lawlessness was abroad"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(一种无法无天的情绪开始滋长)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some had certainly been wounded in these <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="brushes"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(小冲突/小争论/小摩擦)</code></b> with the police, but in the town, where, owing to the combined influences of heat and terror, everything was exaggerated, there was talk of deaths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="A system of patrols was instituted"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(城里开始实行巡逻制度)</code></b> and often in the empty, sweltering streets, heralded by a clatter of horse hoofs on the cobbles, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a detachment of mounted police"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(一分队的骑警)</code></b> would make its way between the parallel lines of close-shut windows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now and again a gunshot was heard; the special brigade recently <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="detailed"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(派遣/指示)</code></b> to destroy cats and dogs, as possible carriers of infection, was at work. And these whipcrack sounds startling the silence increased the nervous tension already existing in the town.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was plain to see that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="spring had spent itself"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(春天已经逝去)</code></b>, lavished its ardor on the myriads of flowers that were bursting everywhere into bloom, and now was being crushed out by the twofold onslaught of heat and plague.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="rang hollow"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(给人以空洞的印象)</code></b> in the silence of the closed town, they had lost the golden spell of happier summers. Plague had killed all colors, vetoed pleasure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The town was open to the sea and its young folk made free of the beaches. But this summer, for all its nearness, the sea was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="out of bounds"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(禁止进入)</code></b>; young limbs had no longer the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="run"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(自由出入的权力/随意使用的权力)</code></b> of its delights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“The newspapers and the authorities are <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="playing ball with"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(与...合作)</code></b> the plague. They fancy they’re <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="scoring off"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(打败)</code></b> it because a hundred and thirty is a smaller figure than nine hundred and ten.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But under the prolonged strain it seemed that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="hearts had toughened"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(心肠变硬了)</code></b>; people lived beside those groans or walked past them as though they had become the normal speech of men.</p>
  </li>
