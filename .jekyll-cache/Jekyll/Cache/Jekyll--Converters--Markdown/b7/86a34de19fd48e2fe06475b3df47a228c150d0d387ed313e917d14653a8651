    <p>Thus even when the plague had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="run its course"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(任其发展/自生自灭)</code></b>, they went on living by its standards. They were, in short, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="behind the times"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(落伍/过时)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, generally speaking, the epidemic was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in retreat"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(败退)</code></b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="all along the line"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(时时/到处/全线)</code></b>; the official <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title=""><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">communiqués</code></b>, which had at first encouraged no more than shadowy, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="half-hearted"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(不热心的/冷淡的)</code></b> hopes, now confirmed the popular belief that the victory was won and the enemy <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="abandoning his positions"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(丢失阵地)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Still, had anyone been told a month earlier that a train had just left or a boat <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="put in"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________([船]入港/停靠港口)</code></b>, or that cars were to be allowed on the streets again, the news would have been received with looks of incredulity; where as in mid-January, an announcement of this kind would have caused no surprise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them plague had imbued with a skepticism so thorough that it was now a second nature; they had become <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="\ ə-ˈlər-jik \ having an aversion 厌恶"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allergic</code></b> to hope in any form.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, though for weary months and months they had endured their long ordeal with dogged perseverance, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="the first thrill of hope - (thrill 是兴奋/激动的意思，这里表示希望给人们带来的那种激动和刺激)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(一线希望待来的兴奋感)</code></b> had been enough to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="to cause to drop or be dispersed"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shatter</code></b> what fear and hopelessness had failed to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="to diminish in function, ability, or quality - to weaken or make worse"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impair</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Really, however, it is doubtful if this could be called a victory. All that could be said was that the disease seemed to be leaving as <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="unaccountable - INEXPLICABLE, STRANGE"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unaccountably</code></b> as it had come.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of others—chiefly those who had been living until now in forced separation from those they loved—the rising wind of hope, after all these months of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="\ ˈdu̇r-ən(t)s also ˈdyu̇r- \ restraint by or as if by physical force 监禁"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">durance</code></b> and depression, had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="fanned impatience to a blaze"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________([前文-希望如风一般]将人们的不耐烦点燃起来)</code></b> and swept away their self-control.</p>
