I"<p>This part gleaned tips around articulating conceptual topics for an API product out of <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_codesamples_bestpractices.html">Tomâ€™s API documentation tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-the-why-not-the-what">Focus on the why, not the what</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explain why youâ€™re doing, what youâ€™re doing, not the detailed play-by-play of whatâ€™s going on, especially when the <em>what</em> refers more to standard programming mechanics that arenâ€™t unique to your API.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>what</strong>: In this code, several arguments are passed to jQueryâ€™s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ajax</code> method. The response is assigned to the data argument of the callback function, which in this case is success.</li>
    <li><strong>why</strong>: Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ajax</code> method from jQuery because it allows for asynchronous responses that wonâ€™t block the loading of your page.</li>
  </ul>
