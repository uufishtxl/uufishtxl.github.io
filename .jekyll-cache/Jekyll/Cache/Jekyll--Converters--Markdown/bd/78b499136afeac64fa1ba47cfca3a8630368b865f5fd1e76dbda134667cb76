    <p>No man can live on the stretch all the time, with his energy and will-power strained to the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="breaking-point"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å´©æºƒçš„ç‚¹)</code></b>, and it is a joy to be able to relax at last and loosen nerves and muscles that were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="braced for - (brace - [ä¸ºå›°éš¾æˆ–åäº‹]åšå‡†å¤‡/é˜²å¤‡)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä¸ºæ–—äº‰åšå¥½å‡†å¤‡)</code></b> the struggle.</p>

    <p>But still Tarrou said nothing, and finally Rieux went up to the bed.
