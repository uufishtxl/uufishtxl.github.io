    <p>All else <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="took a back place"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(é™åˆ°æ¬¡è¦çš„åœ°ä½)</code></b>; that daily there were new victims counted for little <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="beside"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä¸...ç›¸æ¯”)</code></b> that staggering fact: the weekly total showed a decrease.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other surprises were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="in store - (for sb)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å°†è¦å‘ç”Ÿåœ¨æŸäººèº«ä¸Š/å°±è¦å‡ºç°åœ¨æŸäººèº«ä¸Š)</code></b> for him. About the same time there was brought to the hospital a girl whose case Rieux diagnosed as hopeless, and he had her sent immediately to the isolation ward.</p>

    <p>One of the signs that a return to the golden age of health was secretly awaited was that our fellow citizens, careful though they were not to voice their hope, now began to talk â€“ in, it is true, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a carefully detached tone - (detached - exhibiting an aloof objectivity usually free from prejudice or self-interest)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è‹¥æ— å…¶äº‹çš„è¯­è°ƒ)</code></b> â€“ of the new order of life that would set in after the plague.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="All the same"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è¡¨ç¤ºè½¬æŠ˜ï¼Œå°½ç®¡å¦‚æ­¤)</code></b>, this new development was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="the talk of the town"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æˆäº†é•‡ä¸Šçš„çƒ­é—¨è¯é¢˜)</code></b>, and people began to nurse hopes none the less heartfelt for being <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="unavowed - (æœ¬ä¹‰-æœªå…¬å¼€å‘å¸ƒçš„)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä¸ä¾¿æ˜è¨€çš„)</code></b>.</p>

  <li>
    <p>It was as if the plague had been <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="hounded down and cornered - (hound - è¿½é€/çº ç¼ )"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(è¿½å›´å µæˆª)</code></b>, and its sudden weakness lent new strength to the blunted weapons so far used against it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rieux remarked to Tarrou that her recovery was â€œagainst all the rules!â€ But in the course of the next week four similar cases <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="came to his notice."><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å¼•èµ·äº†ä»–çš„æ³¨æ„)</code></b></p>

    <p>But in reality behind these mild <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="a strong desire to achieve something high or great"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aspirations</code></b> lurked wild, extravagant hopes, and often one of us, becoming aware of this, would hastily add that, even <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="on the rosiest view - (rosy - characterized by or tending to promote optimism)"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(ä»æœ€ä¹è§‚çš„è§’åº¦çœ‹)</code></b>, you couldnâ€™t expect the plague to stop from one day to another.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And in frost-cleansed air the epidemic seemed to lose its virulence, and in each of three consecutive weeks a big drop in the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="death-roll"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æ­»äº¡åå†Œ)</code></b> was announced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus over a relatively brief period the disease lost practically all the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="gains"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å¢åŠ )</code></b> piled up over many months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only at rare moments did the disease <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="brace itself"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(æŒ¯ä½œèµ·æ¥)</code></b> and make as it were a blind and fatal leap at three of four patients whose recovery had been expectedâ€”a truly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="ill-fated"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ill-starred</code></b> few, killed off when <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title=""><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(å¸Œæœ›å¤„äºæœ€å¤§)</code></b>.</p>
