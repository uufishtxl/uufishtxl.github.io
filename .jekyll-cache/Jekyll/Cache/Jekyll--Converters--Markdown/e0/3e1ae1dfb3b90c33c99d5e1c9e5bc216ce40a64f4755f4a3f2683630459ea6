    <p>He, Father Paneloux, refused to have recourse to simple devices enabling him to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="scale the wall"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(攀爬这道高墙)</code></b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was well aware that certain minds, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="schooled"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">________(培养/训练)</code></b> to a more <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="宽容的"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">indulgent</code></b> and conventional morality, might well be dismayed, not to say outraged, by the seemingly excessive standard of Christian virtue about which he was going to speak.</p>
