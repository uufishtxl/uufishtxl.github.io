fh_a: The new Microsoft Surface Go is the perfect size for casual coffee-shop computing, but getting the full experience quickly drives up the price.
fh_b: as a casual computer you can toss in a bag and take anywhere
fh_c: workhorse computer
fh_d: priced on a high side
fh_e: you're looking at a much bigger investment
fh_f: That's because it swaps the usual Core i-series Intel CPUs for lower-end Pentium Processors, which are typically only found in laptops at the budget end of the spectrum (it's a favorite for Black Friday doorbusters, for example).
fh_g: It's a definite step down in processing power.
fh_h: That may be one of the reasons behind shipping the device with Windows 10 S, the Windows variant that restricts you to apps from the official Microsoft app store, supposedly all in the name of security. 
fh_i: The Surface Go feels like it hits a sweet spot between design and functionality.

fi_a: And now the hype around this software bug is dying down.
fi_b: Options up to 32GB of RAM and 4TB of flash storage can greatly help with video production.
fi_c: The touch bar still feels like a technology in search of a purpose.
fi_d: Get ready for some serious sticker shock if you want the new MacBook Pro's most-buzzed-about components and features.
fi_e: To say things got off to a rocky start is putting it mildly.
fi_f: That's expensive, even for the type of creative or technical professionals who would be in the market for a machine like this.
fi_g: The rest of the line is rumored to be getting a refresh before the end of the year
fi_h: Support for twice as much RAM (now up to 32GB)
fi_i: Previously, the 15-inch Pro topped out at a seventh-gen quad-core Core i7, itself no slouch, after the last line update in spring 2017
fi_j: When Apple briefed me on the new Pros, the company offered in-person testimonials and demos from several power users
fi_k: What's the biggest issue people have with the Macbook's current keyboard design? Is it that the ultraflat keys don't have the same tactile responses as the older, deeper keys? Is it the stories about the small particles getting wedged in the tight keycaps, leaving some keys sticky or unresponsive?Or is it that the keyboard was just too clacky and loud
fi_l: Not to the point where the keyboard ceases to function, but it was still frustrating when it happened
fi_m: At the same time, I've talked to Macbook owners who have had to send their still-new laptops away for keyboard repair, so it is a real issue form some
fi_n: Apple clearly wants pro-level customers to feel like they're being heard and that their needs are understood and addressed
fi_o: It's a clear winner
fi_p: However, it sometimes feels like it's two steps forward and one step back. The generally impressive iMac Pro is still built around a years-old design and is locked into its nonupgradeable display and components. These new MacBook Pro models  finally have the CPU and memory horsepower to make handling large files and complex tasks easier (if you pay for the biggest upgrades), but the keyboard saga and embarrassing thermal throttling glitch distracted from an otherwise solid upgrade cycle, albeit one lacking significant leaps such as design overhual or the addition of Face ID
fi_q: Apple's vision of the new modular Mac Pro fits a traditional slide in a new RAM and video card vision, or means daisy-chaining locked-down Blackmagic boxes is anyone's guess
fi_r: However, if you already have a current-design Macbook Pro and you don't need cutting-edge power or more memory headroom, there's probably not enough new to justify a new purchase
