## Preprocessing: Install conversion plugin

Given that the browser itself cannot read `Sass`, you have to compile your `Sass` to `css`. This is where **Live Sass Compiler** comes into play. Find the plugin on your **VS Code** and get it installed. When install completes, you may find its icon at the lower-right corner, as is shown below.

Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS fiel that you can use in your website.
