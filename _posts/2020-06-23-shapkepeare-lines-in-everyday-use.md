Crack of doom

Teeth set on edge

One fell swoop

Tongue in your head

Good riddance

Send me packing

Dead as a door-nail

Eyesore

A laughing stock

The devil incarnate

Stony-hearted villain

Bloody-minded

Blinking idiot

By Jove!

O Lord!

Tut tut!

What the dickens!

For goodness' sake!

But me no buts

It is all one to me
