This part gleaned tips around articulating conceptual topics for an API product out of [Tom's API documentation tutorial](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docconceptual.html).

## Overview 

### Purpose

-   Enables users to grasp the purpose of the API at a high-level. 
-   List scenarios to give users context they need to evaluate whether the API is relevant to their needs.
-   To users, the most pivotal question is what information your API returns.


### Market problem & intended audience

-   Explain the market problem your API product solves: What is your product.
-   Pinpoint the target audience of your product: Who your API is for.
