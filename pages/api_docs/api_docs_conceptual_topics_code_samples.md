This part gleaned tips around articulating conceptual topics for an API product out of [Tom's API documentation tutorial](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_codesamples_bestpractices.html).

## Focus on the why, not the what


> Explain why you're doing, what you're doing, not the detailed play-by-play of what's going on, especially when the *what* refers more to standard programming mechanics that aren't unique to your API.
> -    **what**: In this code, several arguments are passed to jQuery's `ajax` method. The response is assigned to the data argument of the callback function, which in this case is success.
> -    **why**: Use the `ajax` method from jQuery because it allows for asynchronous responses that won't block the loading of your page.
