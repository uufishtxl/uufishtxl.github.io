This part gleaned tips around articulating conceptual topics for an API product out of [Tom's API documentation tutorial](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_doc_getting_started_section.html).

## Getting Started

An equivalance to the Hello World tutorial in developer documentation. Make the output simplest. The goal is merely to get users to get an end-to-end sense of how your product works.

Break down your Getting Started tutorial into several segments, such as:

-   Signing up for an account
-   Getting API keys
-   Making a request
-   Evaluating the response

Put a link to the Getting Started tutorial on your documentation homepage.

### Run-in-Postman vs Swagger UI

| **Product** | **Highs** | **Lows** |
| **Run in postman** |  Able to save the calls users make | Cannot incorporate parameter and endpoint description |
| **Swagger UI** | In-browser experience | Cannot save the calls user make |

### Keywords you should know about the getting started tutorial

-   The call being **simplistic**
-   Hold the developer's hand
-   Demonstrate a **beginning to end, full** process
