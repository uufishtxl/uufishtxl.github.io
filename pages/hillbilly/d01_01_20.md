# Day 1

4.  Uncle Pet came next. Uncle Pet was a tall man with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_a1}}">`________(一种很尖锐刺人的机智)`</b> and a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.raunchy}}">`raunchy`</b> sense of humor.

4.  But <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_b1}}">`________(这种魅力之下隐藏着暴脾气)`</b>.

4.  He refused to speak to the police about the incident or <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_c1}}">`________(诉诸诉讼)`</b>.

4.  When I found his giant <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.marijuana}}">`marijuana`</b> plant in the backyard of the old <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.homestead}}">`homestead`</b>, he didn’t try to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_d1}}">`________(对它进行解释)`</b>.

4.  I feared this because, according to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_e1}}">`________(家里的传说)`</b>, Mamaw had nearly killed a man.

4.  Mamaw walked outside to see two men loading the family’s cow—<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_f1}}">`________(宝贵的财产)`</b> in a world without running water—into the back of a truck. She ran inside, grabbed a rifle, and fired a few rounds. One of the men collapsed—the result of a shot to the leg—and the other jumped into the truck and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.undefined_f2}}">`________(尖叫着逃跑了)`</b>.

4.  The <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.would-be-thief}}">`would-be thief`</b> could barely crawl, so Mamaw approached him, raised <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_g1}}">`________((工具或武器)行使主要功能的那一头)`</b> of her rifle to the man’s head, and prepared to finish the job. Luckily for him, Uncle Pet intervened.

4.  Even knowing what <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_h1}}">`________(持枪的疯子)`</b> Mamaw was, I find this story hard to believe. I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.undefined_h2}}">`________(逐一询问)`</b> members of my family, and about half had never heard the story.

4.  Each time someone stole a bike from our porch (three times, by my count), or broke into her car and took the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_i1}}">`________(零钱)`</b>, or stole a delivery, she’d tell me, like a general giving his troops marching orders, “There is nothing lower than the poor stealing from the poor.

1.  These men were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_j1}}">`________(口口相授传下来的家族传统的守门人)`</b>, and I was their best student.

2.  Most of this tradition was far from <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_k1}}">`________(少儿适宜)`</b>.

3.  Almost all of it involved the kind of violence that should <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_l1}}">`________(足以让人坐牢)`</b>.

4.  One of the most common tales of Breathitt’s gore <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd1_m1}}">`________(围绕着)`</b> an older man in town who was accused of raping a young girl.

1. In an admirable display of journalistic <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.pith}}">`pith`</b>, the paper reported: “Man found dead. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd2_a1}}">`________(违规违法的行为)`</b> expected.”

2. My people were extreme, but extreme <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd2_b1}}">`________(服务于)`</b> something—defending a sister’s honor or ensuring that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd2_b2}}">`________(犯罪是要付出代价的)`</b>.

1. There’s definitely <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd3_a1}}">`________(a core accuracy at the heart of a claim or narrative)`</b> to that.

2. But more than anything, the Blanton men were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd3_b1}}">`________(活化石)`</b> of the hills of Kentucky.

3. When <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd3_c1}}">`________(叶子变色)`</b> in October, it seems as if every mountain in town is on fire.

4. Mamaw shielded me from the worst of Jackson, but you can keep reality <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd3_d1}}">`________(在无法靠近的地方)`</b> only so long.

5. My curiosity <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.piqued}}">`piqued`</b>, I looked closer and counted no fewer than eight pairs of eyes, all looking at me from three windows with an unsettling combination of fear and longing.

6. An epidemic of prescription drug addiction has <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd3_f1}}">`________(扎根了)`</b>.

7. She was an academic star in high school and later earned a college degree, the first <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd3_g1}}">`________(在她三口之家（与单亲家庭 single-parent family相对）)`</b> to do so.

1. This tendency might <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd4_a1}}">`________(造就)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hbyd4_a2}}">`________(心理承受能力)`</b>, but it also makes it hard for Appalachians to look at themselves honestly.
