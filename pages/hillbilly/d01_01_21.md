2. Things have gotten so bad that last summer, after my cousin Mike buried his mother, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_b1}}">`________(他立即想到的就是)`</b> selling her house.

3. If there is any temptation to judge these problems as the narrow concern of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.backwoods}}">`backwoods`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.holler}}">`holler`</b>s, a glimpse at my own life reveals that Jackson’s plight has <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_c1}}">`________(成为了主流)`</b>.

4. Hillbillies like to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_d1}}">`________(为很多词添加自己的意思)`</b>.

5. My grandparents—Mamaw and Papaw—were, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_e1}}">`________(毫无疑问地)`</b>, the best things that ever happened to me.

6. They spent the last two decades of their lives showing me the value of love and stability and teaching me <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_f1}}">`________(人生哲学)`</b> that most people learn from their parents.

7. Both did their part to ensure that I had the self-confidence and the right opportunities to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_g1}}">`________(到一个公平的机会去(实现)美国梦)`</b>.

8. Papaw’s distant cousin—also Jim Vance—married into the Hatfield family and joined a group of former Confederate soldiers and sympathizers called the Wildcats. When Cousin Jim murdered former Union soldier Asa Harmon McCoy, he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_h1}}">`________(开始了 START OUT)`</b> one of the most famous <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_h2}}">`________(家庭的不和)`</b>s in American history.

9. Hattie felt sorry for the young motherless boy and became <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_i1}}">`________(代理妈妈)`</b> to my grandfather.

10. And one that could have <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_j1}}">`________(左右一场选举)`</b>, no less!

11. And as scary as her lineage was, Mamaw Bonnie herself was so terrifying that, many decades later, a Marine Corps recruiter would tell me that I’d find <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_k1}}">`________(新兵训练营)`</b> easier than living at home.

12. At that time, as the post–World War II <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.euphoria}}">`euphoria`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_l1}}">`________(逐渐消失)`</b> and people began to adjust to a world at peace, there were two types of people in Jackson: those who <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_l2}}">`________(将生活从某地连根拔除)`</b> and planted them in the industrial powerhouses of the new America, and those who didn’t.

13. This is the story my grandparents told me, and like most family legends it’s largely true but <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_m1}}">`________(与细节多少有点出入)`</b>.

14. And <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_n1}}">`________(根据Boonie South的估量)`</b>, Mamaw and Papaw’s departure involved a bit more scandal than any of us realized.

15. And that pregnancy added a number of pressures that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_o1}}">`________(使当前成为做某事的好时机)`</b> leave Jackson: my intimidating, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.grizzled}}">`grizzled`</b> war-veteran great-grandfather; the Blanton Brothers, who had already earned a reputation for defending Mamaw’s honor; and an interconnected group of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.gun-toting}}">`gun-toting`</b> hillbillies who immediately knew all about Bonnie Blanton’s pregnancy.

16. Mamaw’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_p1}}">`________(第一次进入成年期)`</b> ended in tragedy.

17. Whatever mix of economic opportunity and family necessity <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_q1}}">`________(将我的祖父母扔到俄亥俄州)`</b>, they were there, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_q2}}">`________(没有退路了)`</b>.

18. Armco didn’t just hire the young men of Appalachian Kentucky; they actively encouraged those men to bring their <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_r1}}">`________(大家庭)`</b>.

19. It ended as the Great Depression <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_s1}}">`________(极大地打击了北部经济)`</b>.

20. Precise numbers are tough to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_t1}}">`________(发现、查明、确定)`</b> because studies typically measure “net out-migration”—as in the total number of people who left minus the number of people who came in.

21. Many families constantly traveled back and forth, which <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_u1}}">`________(歪曲了数据的正确性)`</b>.

22. But it is certain that many millions of people traveled along the “hillbilly highway”—<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_v1}}">`________(修辞手法)`</b> that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hby_d2_v2}}">`________(抓住了...的意思)`</b> of Northerners who saw their cities and towns flooded with people like my grandparents.
