1.  The costs of moving are so high that many people <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_a1}}">`________(停留原地/不搬离)`</b>.

2.  For reasons I can’t begin to fathom, the city’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_b1}}">`________(智囊团)`</b> decided to turn our beautiful riverfront into Lake Middletown, an infrastructural project that apparently involved shoveling tons of dirt into the river and hoping something interesting would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_b2}}">`________(由...引起)`</b> it.

3.  Many of the city’s best parks and facilities were bought with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_c1}}">`________(Armco提供的资金)`</b>.

4.  Armco’s people <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_d1}}">`________([在组织中]董事会身居要职)`</b> of many of the important local organizations, and it helped to fund the schools.

5.  For example, Inland Container, in Middletown, had 220 Kentuckyians <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_e1}}">`________(在员工花名册上)`</b>, 117 of whom were from Wolfe County alone.

6.  While labor relations no doubt had declined by the 1980s, much of the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_f1}}">`________(声誉/商誉)`</b> built by Armco (and similar companies) remained.

7.  The other reason most still call it Armco is that Kawasaki was a Japanese company, and in a town full of World War II <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.vets}}">`vets`</b> and their families, you’d have thought that General Tojo himself had decided to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_g1}}">`________(开设店铺)`</b> in southwest Ohio when the merger was announced.

8.  Even Papaw—who once promised he’d <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_h1}}">`________(与子女脱离关系)`</b> his children if they bought a Japanese car—stopped complaining a few days after they announced the merger.

9.  If companies like Armco were going to survive, they would have to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.retool}}">`retool`</b>.

10.  job. It never occurred to me that Armco wouldn’t be around forever, funding scholarships, building parks, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_j1}}">`________(举办免费音乐会)`</b>.

11.  Even at Roosevelt Elementary—where, thanks to Middletown geography, most people’s parents lacked a college education—no one wanted to have a blue-collar career and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_k1}}">`________(有着能过上受人尊重的中产阶级生活的前景)`</b>.

12.  Many kids seem to feel that way today. A few years ago I spoke with Jennifer McGuffey, a Middletown High School teacher who works with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_l1}}">`________(高危青年/问题青年)`</b>.

13.  My grandfather loved the company and knew <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_m1}}">`________(任何型号和款式)`</b> of car built from Armco steel.

14.  Even after most American car companies <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_n1}}">`________(过渡/变迁...)`</b> from steel-bodied cars, Papaw would stop at <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_n2}}">`________(二手车商)`</b> whenever he saw an old Ford or Chevy.

15.  Many parents <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_o1}}">`________(对这种现象并无异议)`</b>.

16.  When my sister or I struggled in school, I’d overhear things like “Well, maybe she’s just not that great at <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.fractions}}">`fractions`</b>,” or “J.D.’s more of a numbers kid, so I wouldn’t worry about that spelling test.

17.  One of our neighbors was a lifetime welfare recipient, but in between asking my grandmother to borrow her car or offering to trade food stamps for cash <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_q1}}">`________(溢价/在票面价值以上)`</b>, she’d <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.blather}}">`blather`</b> on about the importance of industriousness.

18.  This was the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.construct}}">`construct`</b> she’d built in her head: Most of the beneficiaries of the system were extravagant <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.moochers}}">`moochers`</b>, but she—despite never having worked in her life—was an obvious exception.

19.  For many, part-time work is all they have access to, because the Armcos of the world are <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_s1}}">`________(停止营业)`</b> and their skill sets don’t fit well in the modern economy.

20.  But whatever the reasons, the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.rhetoric}}">`rhetoric`</b> of hard work conflicts with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_t1}}">`________(现实情况)`</b>.

21.  The teacher would announce the number of the day, and we’d <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_u1}}">`________(一个接着一个做某事)`</b>and announce a math equation that produced the number. 

22.  A few moments later, while I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_v1}}">`________(为...感到高兴)`</b> my brilliance, another student announced, “Ten times three.”

23.  None of us raised a hand. For my part, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_w1}}">`________(我崩溃了)`</b>.

24.  It wasn’t something I’d learned in school, and my family didn’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_x1}}">`________(无所事事)`</b> and work on math problems.

25.  I would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_y1}}">`________(自责 blame or criticize yourself, usually in a way that is unfair or unnecessary)`</b> when I didn’t understand a concept, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_y2}}">`________(leave angrily)`</b>, defeated.

26.  Mom was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_4b_z1}}">`________(从来不是擅长数学的人)`</b>, but she took me to the public library before I could read, got me a library card, showed me how to use it, and always made sure I had access to kids’ books at home.
