1.  He was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_a1}}">`________([把孩子]送人)`</b>, they said.

2.  I knew that he loved Kentucky, its beautiful mountains, and its <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_b1}}">`________(起伏的绿色)`</b> horse country. 

3.  “He’s a toothless fucking <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.retard}}">`retard`</b>,” she’d tell Mom, I suspect for reasons of class and culture: Mamaw had done everything in her power to be better than <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_c1}}">`________(比起她的出生)`</b>.

4.  Though she was hardly rich, she wanted her kids to get an education, obtain white-collar work, and marry <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_d1}}">`________(梳洗整洁的)`</b> middle-class folks—people, in other words, who were nothing like Mamaw and Papaw.

5.  Bob, however, was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_e1}}">`________(典型的南方乡下人)`</b>. 

6.  Half of his teeth had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_f1}}">`________(烂没了)`</b>, and the other half were black, brown, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_f2}}">`________(歪歪扭扭)`</b>, the consequence of a lifetime of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_f3}}">`________(饮用山露酒)`</b> and presumably some missed dental checkups.

7.  He was a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_g1}}">`________(高中辍学生)`</b> who drove a truck for a living.

8.  This seemed <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_h1}}">`________(有点夸张)`</b> even when I was six.

9.  Our new life with Bob <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_i1}}">`________(有种浮于表面、家庭情景剧的感觉)`</b>.

10.  Mom had recently acquired her nursing license, and Bob <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_j1}}">`________(薪水优渥)`</b>, so we had plenty of money.

11.  My life assumed a predictable <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.cadence}}">`cadence`</b>: I’d go to school and come home and eat dinner. 

12.  Mom and I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_l1}}">`________(在...方面建立亲密关系)`</b> other things, especially our favorite sport: football.

13.  Mom checked out books on football strategy from the public library, and we built little models of the field with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_m1}}">`________(彩色美术纸)`</b> and loose change—<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.pennies}}">`pennies`</b> for the defense, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.nickels}}">`nickels`</b> and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.dimes}}">`dimes`</b> for the offense.

14.  We practiced on our construction-paper football field, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_n1}}">`________(检查各种突发事件)`</b>: What happened if a particular <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_n2}}">`________(前锋)`</b> (a shiny nickel) missed his block?

15.  But she did return to a local community college and earn <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_o1}}">`________(副学士)`</b> in nursing.

16.  The night before everything was due, the project looked precisely how it deserved to look: like the work of a third-grader who had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_p1}}">`________(有点懈怠)`</b> a bit.

17.  During my third-grade <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_q1}}">`________(科学竞赛)`</b> project, Mom helped at every stage—from planning the project to assisting with lab notes to assembling the presentation.

18.  It looked like a scientist and a professional artist had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_r1}}">`________(协力做某事)`</b> to create it.

19.  I didn’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_s1}}">`________(没有进入最终一轮)`</b> of the competition.

20.  What that incident taught me—besides the fact that I needed to do my own work—was that Mom cared deeply about <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_t1}}">`________(需要动脑子的事情[猜测])`</b>.

21.  He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_u1}}">`________(年长我5岁，比我重出35磅)`</b>, but I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_u2}}">`________(冲上去打他)`</b> twice as he pushed me down easily.

22.  She never laid a hand on me punitively—she was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.anti-spanking}}">`anti-spanking`</b> in a way must have come from her own bad experiences—but when I asked her what it felt like to be punched in the head, she showed me.

23.  Despite her <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.admonition}}">`admonition`</b> not to start fights, our unspoken <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_w1}}">`________(荣誉准则)`</b> made it easy to convince someone else to start a fight for you. If you really wanted to get into it with someone, all you needed to do was insult his mom. No amount of self-control could withstand <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_w2}}">`________(有技术含量的辱骂妈妈)`</b>.

24.  To <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_x1}}">`________(逃避)`</b> avenging a string of insults was to lose your honor, your dignity, or even your friends.

25.  Mamaw, lurking nearby, intervened in what was certain to be another schoolyard <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_y1}}">`________(笼中比赛 [其实就是打架])`</b>.

26.  The next year, I noticed that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_5_z1}}">`________(班里的恶霸)`</b> had taken a particular interest in a specific victim, an odd kid I rarely spoke to.
