1.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_a1}}">`________(外婆有自己的看法)`</b>: that Mom had tried to detract attention from her cheating and financial problems.

2.   And <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_b1}}">`________(周旋在几个男朋友中间)`</b>, switching partners every few months.

3.  There would be fighting or running away from fights; when <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_c1}}">`________(事情变得特别糟糕)`</b>, Mom would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_c2}}">`________(在我们身上爆发怒气)`</b> or even slap or pinch us. I didn’t like it—who would?—but this new behavior was just strange. Though <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_c3}}">`________(妈妈曾经做过很多事)`</b>, she hadn’t been a partier.

4.  Football cards were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_d1}}">`________(我的命中克星 /我的软肋)`</b>, so I agreed to join her.

5.  This infuriated her more, so she pulled over to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_e1}}">`________(把我往死里打)`</b>.

6.  Eventually Mom broke down the woman’s door and dragged me out as I screamed and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_f1}}">`________(抓住任何能抓的东西)`</b>—the screen door, the guardrails on the steps, the grass on the ground. 

7.  Two police cruisers <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_g1}}">`________(停下车来)`</b>, and the cops who got out put Mom in handcuffs.

8.  I had begun to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_h1}}">`________(打瞌睡)`</b> when <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_h2}}">`________(车门打开)`</b>, and Lindsay crawled into the cruiser with me and clutched me to her chest so tightly that I couldn’t breathe.

9.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_i1}}">`________(脸上带着一种无声的、可怕的愤怒)`</b>.

10.  Mom was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_j1}}">`________(交纳保释金后出狱)`</b> and prosecuted for <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_j2}}">`________(家暴罪行)`</b>.

11.  My grandparents were paying a lot of money for the town’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_k1}}">`________(最有能力的)`</b> lawyer.

12.  The people who ran the courthouse were different from us. The people <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_l1}}">`________(被他们所支配)`</b> were not.

13.  Identity is an odd thing, and I didn’t understand at the time why I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_m1}}">`________(意识到与这些陌生人之间的关系)`</b>.

14.  It is a testament to the class consciousness of my youth that my friends’ <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_n1}}">`________(第一时间想到的是)`</b> the cost of an airplane flight.

15.  Despite the early departure, I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_o1}}">`________(完全没有睡觉)`</b> on the six-hour flight from Cincinnati to San Francisco.

16.  The flight attendant took notice, and by the time we <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_p1}}">`________(到达)`</b> Colorado, I was making regular visits to the cockpit (this was before 9/11), where the pilot gave me brief lessons in flying an airplane and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_p2}}">`________(告知我最新的进程)`</b>.

17.  During one trip we went to the Castro District of San Francisco so that, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_q1}}">`________(用我表姐的话来说)`</b> Rachael, I could learn that gay people weren’t out to molest me.

18.  We ate the same foods, watched the same sports, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_r1}}">`________(信奉一样的宗教)`</b>.

19.  So, for a time, I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.dutifully}}">`dutifully`</b> answered, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_s1}}">`________(如数家珍地告诉人们我们家错综复杂关系网)`</b> that I’d grown accustomed to. I had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_s2}}">`________(同父异母/同母异父的弟弟)`</b> and half sister whom I never saw because my biological father had given me up for adoption.

20.  I had many stepbrothers and stepsisters by one measure, but only two if you <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_t1}}">`________(将计算限制于)`</b> the offspring of Mom’s husband of the moment.

21.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_u1}}">`________(她为了我所做出的英雄行为)`</b> was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_u2}}">`________(传奇)`</b>.

22.  She was above it all, the “one true adult in the house,” as Papaw would say, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_v1}}">`________(我的第一道防线/我的第一保护人)`</b>, even before Mamaw.

23.  Lindsay had learned of a modeling recruitment event at a Dayton hotel, so Mom, Mamaw, Lindsay, and I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_w1}}">`________(挤到外婆的别克车里)`</b> and headed north.

24.  Lindsay was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_x1}}">`________(非常激动)`</b>, and I was, too. This was going to be her <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_x2}}">`________(重大转机)`</b> and, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_x3}}">`________(引申开来/延伸开来)`</b>, our whole family’s.

25.  The ballroom was perfectly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_y1}}">`________(20世纪70年代那种俗气的样子)`</b>: ugly carpet, big chandeliers, and lighting just bright enough to prevent you from stumbling over your own feet. 

26.  I wondered how any <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6b_z1}}">`________(经纪人)`</b> could ever appreciate my sister’s beauty.
