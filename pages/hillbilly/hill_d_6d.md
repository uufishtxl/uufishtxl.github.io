1.  With little <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_a1}}">`________(宗教训练)`</b>, I was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_a2}}">`________(急着去观摩一下真正的教堂)`</b>.

2.  I asked Mom if I could see him, and she agreed, so <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_b1}}">`________(在我的法定父亲离开我生活的同一个夏天，我的生物学父亲又回到了我的生活圈子)`</b>. Mom had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_b2}}">`________(兜了一圈回到原地)`</b>: Having cycled through a number of men in an effort to find me a father, she had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_b3}}">`________(选定)`</b> the original candidate.

3.  His mom remarried early, and though her second husband was a good man, he was also very firm and an <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_c1}}">`________(局外人/外人)`</b>—even the best stepparents <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_c2}}">`________(需要一段时间来适应)`</b>.

4.  There was a medium-sized <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_d1}}">`________(养鱼的池塘)`</b>, a couple of fields for cows and horses, a barn, and a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_d2}}">`________(鸡舍)`</b>.

5.  Every morning the kids would run to the chicken coop and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_e1}}">`________(捡早上那一批的鸡蛋)`</b>—usually seven or eight, a perfect number for a family of five. During the day, we <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_e2}}">`________(在...周围蹦蹦跳跳)`</b> the property with a dog in tow, caught frogs, and chased rabbits.

6.  Dad had built a home with an almost <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.jarring}}">`jarring`</b> serenity.

7.  Even though they believed in <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_g1}}">`________(体罚)`</b>, it was never <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_g2}}">`________(given)`</b> excessively or combined with verbal abuse—<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_g3}}">`________(体罚讲究方法)`</b> and anger-free.

8.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_h1}}">`________(我对爸爸的性格知之甚少)`</b> during his marriage to Mom <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_h2}}">`________(大多数都是从别人口中知道的)`</b>.

9.  He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.credits}}">`credits`</b> a more serious involvement with his faith. In this, Dad <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.embodied}}">`embodied`</b> a phenomenon social scientists have observed for decades: Religious folks are much happier.

10.  In his religious habits, Dad<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_j1}}">`________(以...的固定印象生活)`</b> of a culturally conservative Protestant with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_j2}}">`________(南方出身)`</b>, even though the stereotype is mostly inaccurate.

11.  Indeed, the only conservative Protestants I knew who attended church regularly were my dad and his family. In the middle of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_k1}}">`________(（美国南部和中西部有着较强基督教信仰基础的）《圣经》地带)`</b>, active church attendance is actually quite low.

12.  In a recent <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_l1}}">`________( 盖洛普民调)`</b>, Southerners and Midwesterners reported the highest rates of church attendance in the country.

13.  This pattern of deception <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_m1}}">`________(与...有关)`</b> cultural pressure.

14.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_n1}}">`________(俄亥俄州截然相反)`</b>.

15.  The <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.juxtaposition}}">`juxtaposition`</b> is jarring: Religious institutions remain a positive force in people’s lives, but in a part of the country <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.slammed}}">`slammed`</b> by the decline of manufacturing, joblessness, addiction, and broken homes, church attendance has <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_o1}}">`________(下降)`</b>.

16.  For <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_p1}}">`________(待产妇女)`</b>, it offered a free home with job training and parenting classes.

17.  When Dad faced financial troubles, his church <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_q1}}">`________(团结起来)`</b> and purchased a used car for the family. In the broken world I saw around me—and for the people struggling in that world—religion offered <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.tangible}}">`tangible`</b> assistance to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_q2}}">`________(确保那些虔诚的信徒可以继续正常的生活)`</b>.

18.  For the first time, I heard his side of the story: that the adoption had nothing to do with a desire to avoid child support and that, far from simply “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_r1}}">`________(抛弃我)`</b>” as Mom and Mamaw had said, Dad had hired multiple lawyers and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_r2}}">`________(做了一切法理范围内的事)`</b> to keep me.

19.  He worried that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_s1}}">`________(对抚养权的争夺)`</b> was destroying me.

20.  When he spoke to the court’s child <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.psychiatrist}}">`psychiatrist`</b>, he learned that I had begun <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_t1}}">`________(behave badly)`</b> at school and was showing signs of emotional problems.

21.  After a few weeks in kindergarten, I was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_u1}}">`________(留级)`</b> for a year.

22.  Eventually, Dad told me, he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_v1}}">`________(向上帝祈求三个兆头)`</b> that an adoption was in my best interest.

23.  I don’t doubt the truth of this account, and though I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_w1}}">`________(理解)`</b> the obvious difficulty of the decision, I have never felt comfortable with the idea of leaving your child’s fate to signs from God.

24.  Yet this was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_x2}}">`________(一段微不足道的小插曲)`</b>, all things considered.

25.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_y2}}">`________(总地来说)`</b>, I loved my dad and his church.

26.  I’m not sure if I liked the structure or if I just wanted to share in something that was important to him—both, I suppose—but I became a devoted <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.convert}}">`convert`</b>. I devoured books about <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6d_z1}}">`________(年轻的地球神创论)`</b>, and joined online chat rooms to challenge scientists on the theory of evolution.
