1.  I learned about <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_a1}}">`________(千禧年预言)`</b> and convinced myself that the world would end in 2007.

2.  Dad’s church encouraged all of this because it doubted the wisdom of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.secular}}">`secular`</b> science and the morality of secular music.

3.  I’d heard people joke that if you played Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” backward, you’d hear some <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_c1}}">`________(邪恶倾向)`</b>, but a member of Dad’s church spoke about <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_c2}}">`________(关于Zeppline的传说/迷思)`</b> as if it were actually true.

4.  Evolution and the Big Bang became ideologies to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_d1}}">`________(to deal with a problem or difficult situation)`</b>, not theories to understand. Many of the sermons I heard spent as much time criticizing other Christians as anything else.

5.  I admired my uncle Dan above all other men, but when he spoke of his Catholic acceptance of evolutionary theory, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_e1}}">`________(我的崇拜开始夹杂着些许疑虑)`</b>.

6.  My new faith had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_f1}}">`________(让我开始去留意找到那些异教徒)`</b>. Good friends who interpreted parts of the Bible differently <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_f2}}">`________([对我]产生不良影响)`</b>. Even Mamaw <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_f3}}">`________(失宠)`</b> because her religious views didn’t conflict with her affinity for Bill Clinton.

7.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_g1}}">`________(关于纽约艺术展的讨论在网上沸沸扬扬)`</b> that featured images of Christ or the Virgin Mary covered in feces.

8.  As a young teenager thinking seriously for the first time about what I believed and why I believed it, I had an acute sense that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_h1}}">`________(真正的基督教徒越来越少[猜测])`</b>.

9.  I was eight or nine, maybe younger, and I stumbled upon a broadcast by some <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_i1}}">`________(用地狱火来传教的 [地狱火 - 不忠诚的人将下地狱经历磨难])`</b> preacher.

10.  In my new church, on the other hand, I heard more about the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_j1}}">`________(支持同性恋的游说)`</b> and the war on Christmas than about any particular character trait that a Christian should <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_j2}}">`________(立意/追求)`</b> have.

11.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_k1}}">`________(世界陷入了道德败坏的境地)`</b>—<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_k2}}">`________(倒向)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.Gomorrah}}">`Gomorrah`</b>.

12.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_l1}}">`________(世界末日)`</b> were the natural finish for a culture sliding so quickly toward the abyss.

13.  Nor did I realize that the religious views I developed during my early years with Dad were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_m1}}">`________(为...播下种子)`</b> an outright rejection of the Christian faith.

14.  Her response, more than anything I’ve ever heard, is <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_n1}}">`________(烙印在我的脑海里)`</b>. The hillbilly accent that she usually hid <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_n2}}">`________(从她的嘴里透露出来)`</b>.

15.  After a couple of hours of conversation, he would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_o1}}">`________(漫步走到某个地方)`</b> Mamaw’s house and spend the morning watching TV or playing cards.

16.  If he left at all before dinnertime, he might briefly visit his friend Paul’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_p1}}">`________(五金店)`</b>.

17.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_q1}}">`________(后面的事情已经不记得了)`</b>: I think I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_q2}}">`________(转述了外婆的话)`</b>; we picked her up down the street and sped over to Papaw’s house, no more than a few minutes’ drive away.

18.  Mom ran to the back door, screamed, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_r1}}">`________(绕到前门)`</b>, both to tell Mamaw that he was hunched over in his chair and to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_r2}}">`________(抓起一块石头)`</b>.

19.  She then broke and went in through a window, unlocked and opened the door, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_s1}}">`________(径直走向)`</b> her father.

20.  We all hugged her before <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_t1}}">`________(挤到车里)`</b> and heading back to Mamaw’s. The adults gave me the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.unenviable}}">`unenviable`</b> task of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_t2}}">`________(找到林赛)`</b> and giving her the news.

21.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_u1}}">`________(这时候手机还没有出现)`</b>, and Lindsay, being a seventeen-year-old, was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_u2}}">`________(很难联系到)`</b>.

22.  I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.trudged}}">`trudged`</b> down the street and opened our door. She was walking down the stairs but <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_v1}}">`________(突然停下来)`</b> when she saw my face, red and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.blotchy}}">`blotchy`</b> from crying all day.

23.  Lindsay was a teenager when Papaw died, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_w1}}">`________(正处于[青春期那种]别别扭扭的组合的高峰期)`</b> of thinking you know everything and caring too much about how others perceive you.

24.  He always smelled of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.mildew}}">`mildew`</b>, because he washed his clothes but let them dry “naturally,” meaning packed together in a washing machine.

25.   For me and Lindsay, the fear of imposing <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_y1}}">`________(追随着我们的认知)`</b>, infecting even the food we ate.

26.  We were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_z1}}">`________(被训练成某种状态)`</b> that we couldn’t really depend on people—that, even as children, asking someone for a meal or for help with a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_z2}}">`________(破破烂烂的)`</b> automobile was a luxury that we shouldn’t indulge in too much lest we fully <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_6e_z3}}">`________(积累了大量的善意)`</b> serving as a safety valve in our lives.
