1.  We <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_a1}}">`________(举行了哀悼会)`</b> in Middletown that Thursday so all the locals could pay their respects, then had a second visitation in Jackson on Friday before a Saturday funeral.

2.  Everyone I cared to see came to the funeral in Jackson—Uncle Jimmy and his kids, our extended family and friends, and all of the Blanton men who were still <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_b1}}">`________(活着的)`</b>.

3.  As I sat next to Uncle Jimmy in the pew, I sobbed throughout the hour-long funeral, my eyes so <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_c1}}">`________([眼睛因为长时间哭泣]受刺激)`</b> by the end that I could hardly see. 

4.  Papaw <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_d1}}">`________(筹备了一个计划)`</b>: There were only two exits to Deaton’s, and no one had driven away yet.

5.  Mamaw. They <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_e1}}">`________(守住了出口)`</b> to the funeral home and checked every car. When they encountered an old friend, they explained the situation and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_e2}}">`________(请求帮助)`</b>.

6.  Uncle Pet approached, frustrated that Mamaw and Papaw were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_f1}}">`________(堵塞交通)`</b>. When they explained, Pet <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_f2}}">`________(狂笑起来)`</b>: “He’s asleep in the church pew, let me show you.”

7.  I thought about Papaw buying me a BB gun <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_g1}}">`________(带瞄准镜的)`</b>.

8.  From Papaw, I had learned excellent <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_h1}}">`________(基础知识/技能)`</b>, and I qualified with an M16 rifle as an expert, the highest category, with one of the highest scores in my entire <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.platoon}}">`platoon`</b>.

9.  Papaw was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_i1}}">`________(脾气坏到极致)`</b>. To every suggestion or behavior he didn’t like, Papaw had one reply: “Bullshit.” <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_i2}}">`________(每个人都知道该闭嘴了)`</b>.

10.  The suggestion <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_j1}}">`________(让外公措手不及)`</b>.

11.  He taught me that lack of knowledge and lack of intelligence were not the same. The former could be remedied with a little patience and a lot of hard work. And the latter?  “Well, I guess you’re <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_k1}}">`________(没辙了)`</b>.”

12.  I thought about losing my temper with Mom or Lindsay or Mamaw, and how those were among the few times Papaw ever <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_l1}}">`________(表现出了他卑劣的一面)`</b>, because, as he once told me, “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_l2}}">`________(衡量男人的标准)`</b> is how he treats the women in his family.”

13.  Mamaw, too, seemed <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_m1}}">`________(失神)`</b>. Kentucky was usually the one place where she was completely <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_m2}}">`________(如鱼得水/觉得自在)`</b>.

14.  At Perkins, our favorite breakfast spot, Mamaw’s mouth would sometimes <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_n1}}">`________(换来...的请求)`</b> from the manager that she keep her voice down or watch her language. “That fucker,” she’d mutter <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_n2}}">`________(压着嗓子说话)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.chastened}}">`chastened`</b> and uncomfortable.

15.  In Jackson, among old friends and real hillbillies, she <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_o1}}">`________(不需要在开口前思量措辞)`</b>.

16.  They found an extensive magazine collection, including a few issues of Beaver Hunt (a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.periodical}}">`periodical`</b> that I can assure you has nothing to do with aquatic mammals).

17.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_q1}}">`________(稍微思量了会后)`</b>, she changed her mind. “With my luck,” she told me, “we’ll get in a crash on the way back to Ohio and the police will find these damned things in my trunk.

18.  I didn’t see at first that something had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_r1}}">`________(改变了)`</b>.

19.  At home, she <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_s1}}">`________(一丁点的情绪控制都做不到了)`</b>.

20.  Papaw’s death <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_t1}}">`________(解释了一些一直隐藏在暗处的事情)`</b>.

21.  Similarly, Mamaw’s occasional references to Mom “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_u1}}">`________(intoxicated by alcohol or drugs especially, drunk)`</b>” seemed like random comments of a woman known for her willingness to say anything, not a diagnosis of a deteriorating reality.

22.  But I always had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_v1}}">`________(逃生通道)`</b>.

23.  From the poverty of the holler to Papaw’s abuse, from Aunt Wee’s teenage marriage to Mom’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_w1}}">`________(犯罪记录)`</b>, Mamaw had spent the better part of her seven decades managing crises.

24.  In the months after Papaw’s death, I remembered the woman I found in an isolated corner of Deaton’s funeral home and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_x1}}">`________(总觉得)`</b> that, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_x2}}">`________(不管外婆表现出来什么样的力量)`</b>, that other woman lived somewhere inside her.

25.  We didn’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_y1}}">`________(有组织性/纪律性)`</b>.

26.  When Lindsay learned that I got the beer from a friend of hers, she didn’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_z1}}">`________(发火/失去自制力)`</b> or laugh at the indulgence; she kicked everyone out and then lectured me on <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_7_z2}}">`________(滥用药物)`</b>.
