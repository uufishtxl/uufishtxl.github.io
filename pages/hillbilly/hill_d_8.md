1.  Mamaw knew little of how this arrangement affected me, partly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_a1}}">`________(特意安排的)`</b>.

2.  Mom’s demand <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_b1}}">`________(一副理所应得的样子)`</b>.

3.  I refused. Sensing my resistance, Mom <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_c1}}">`________(改变了态度)`</b>.

4.  She survived successive <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_d1}}">`________(触犯法律)`</b>. And now she was doing everything she could to survive <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_d2}}">`________(护士协会的突击)`</b>.

5.  I told Mamaw that enabling Mom made it worse and that if she had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_e1}}">`________(运用自己的威严让她停止[吸毒])`</b> thirty years earlier, then maybe Mom wouldn’t be begging her son for clean piss.

6.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_f1}}">`________(外婆的脸都气白了)`</b>, and she refused to even look me in the eye. What I had said had clearly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_f2}}">`________(触到了她的痛处)`</b>.

7.  First, Mamaw <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.assuaged}}">`assuaged`</b> my fears. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_g1}}">`________(吸几次大麻)`</b> over three weeks wouldn’t show up <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_g2}}">`________(在筛选中表现出来)`</b>, she told me.

8.  "You didn’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_h1}}">`________(吸入[毒品])`</b>, even if you tried.” Then she addressed the morality of it.

9.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_i1}}">`________(外婆的一生，诠释了如何对人失去信任)`</b>, but Mamaw always found a way to believe in the people she loved.

10.  Though I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_j1}}">`________(按外婆说的照做了)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_j2}}">`________(我心里某些东西却破碎了)`</b> that morning.

11.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_k1}}">`________(尿检的事情)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_k2}}">`________(对于外婆来说也是压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草)`</b> too.

12.  I didn’t even have to pack, because much of what I owned remained at Mamaw’s as I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_l1}}">`________(流转于不同的地方)`</b>.

13.  I still harbored the insecurity that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_m1}}">`________(我对她来说是一个负担)`</b>.

14.  More important, she was a hard woman to live with, quick-witted and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_n1}}">`________(牙尖嘴利)`</b>.

15.  “Mamaw was really <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_o1}}">`________(对你很严厉)`</b>.

16.  Get good grades, get a job, and “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_p1}}">`________(挪一挪你的屁股来帮我干点活)`</b>” There was no <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_p2}}">`________(任务列表)`</b>; I just had to help her with whatever she was doing.

17.  Mamaw <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_q1}}">`________(刀子嘴豆腐心)`</b>, at least with me.

18.  The best part about living with Mamaw was that I began to understand <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_r1}}">`________(是什么在驱动她)`</b>.

19.  Living with Mamaw, I learned that she and her sister, Rose—a woman of uncommon kindness—<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_s1}}">`________(翻脸了)`</b> after their mother died.

20.  In her old age, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_t1}}">`________(活动能力有限)`</b>, Mamaw loved to watch TV. She preferred raunchy humor and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_t2}}">`________(史诗剧)`</b>, so she had a lot of options. But her favorite show by far was the HBO <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_t3}}">`________(黑帮故事)`</b>The Sopranos.

21.  Though he murdered countless enemies and drank excessively, the only criticism she ever <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_u1}}">`________(imposed on)`</b> him involved his infidelity.

22.  She <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_v1}}">`________(住进了护理院)`</b> for a few months to recover, forcing me to live alone, an experience that happily didn’t last long.

23.  Now that I’m a lawyer, I marvel that we never considered <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_w1}}">`________(一起医疗事故诉讼)`</b> against the doctor who operated unnecessarily on her back.

24.  Perhaps she felt that I would never appreciate that she loved me unless she offered <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_x1}}">`________(一叠钱)`</b>.

25.  And we were poor, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_y1}}">`________(这种[穷困的]状态外婆却奉为荣耀的勋章)`</b> but one I’d hardly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_y2}}">`________(需要经过努力才能接受)`</b>.

26.  According to Middletown High School legend, a student <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_8_z1}}">`________(打电话过来威胁有炸弹)`</b> during one of Selby’s exams, hiding the explosive device in a bag in his locker.
