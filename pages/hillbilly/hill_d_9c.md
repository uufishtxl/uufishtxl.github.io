3.  But there’s something powerful about realizing that you’ve <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_c1}}">`________(低看自己)`</b>—that somehow your mind confused lack of effort for inability.

4.  A few days after my twenty-third birthday, I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_d1}}">`________(第一次买贵重物品)`</b> I’d ever made.

5.  I witnessed <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_e1}}">`________(飞机失事后的严重后果)`</b> into a residential neighborhood. 

6.  Not long after I moved to Columbus, one of my best friends began working as <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_f1}}">`________(促销主管)`</b> for a local radio station, so I always knew what was happening around town and always <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_f2}}">`________(知道/了解)`</b> the city’s best events, from local festivals to VIP seating for the annual fireworks show.

Though I didn’t know it, I was witnessing a phenomenon that social scientists call “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_g1}}">`________(人才流失)`</b>”—people who are able to leave struggling cities often do, and when they find a new home with educational and work opportunities, they stay there.

8.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_h1}}">`________(without exception/every person in a group)`</b>, all of them had found careers outside of their hometowns, and none of them had any interest in ever going back.

11.  I didn’t want to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_k1}}">`________(做一份与我的“出身”相符合的工作)`</b>.

12.  Though the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_l1}}">`________(退伍账单)`</b> paid for a significant chunk of my education, and Ohio State charged relatively little to an in-state resident, I still needed to cover about twenty thousand dollars of expenses on my own.

13.  He was a good man, and I liked his politics, so when constituents called and complained, I tried to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_m1}}">`________(解释他的立场)`</b>.

14.  After a few months at the Ohio Senate, as my bills piled up and I found fewer and fewer ways to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_n1}}">`________(让我的收支平衡)`</b> (one can <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_n2}}">`________(鲜血)`</b> only twice per week, I learned), I decided to get another job.

15.  He sternly told me that I should focus on my education and not <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_o1}}">`________(让打工分散注意力，阻碍我[的学习])`</b>.

18.  I ignored him and kept on living as though <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_r1}}">`________(白加黑能治百病)`</b>.

19.  After a week of this, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_s1}}">`________(我的尿液变成了恶心的棕色)`</b>, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_s2}}">`________(我的体温高达华氏103°)`</b>. I realized I might need to take care of myself, so I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_s3}}">`________(喝了点泰诺)`</b>, drank a couple of beers, and went to sleep.

23.  The senators and policy staff debating the bill had little appreciation for the role of payday lenders in <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_w1}}">`________(地下经济)`</b> that people like me occupied.

24.  To them, payday lenders were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_x1}}">`________(像鲨鱼般的掠夺者)`</b>, charging high interest rates on loans and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.exorbitant}}">`exorbitant`</b> fees for <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.hill_d_9c_x2}}">`________(兑现支票)`</b>.
