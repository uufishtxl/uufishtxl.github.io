Adjust Brightness/Contrast values.

### `Brightness`

Move the joystick up or down to adjust the luminance of the backlight from 0 to 100.

### `Contrast`

Adjust brightness first, and then adjust contrast only if further adjustment is desired. Move the joystick up or down to adjust between darkness and lightness from 0 to 100.
