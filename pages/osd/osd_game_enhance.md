Adjust Game Enhance Mode to optimize your gaming experience.

## `Off`

Disable the functions under Game Enhance Mode.

## `Timer`

Disable or enable the timer at the upper left corner of the display. The timer shows the time elapse since the game starts. Select an option from the time-interval list to keep you aware of the remaining time.

## `Frame Rate`

Selecting On allows you to display the current frames per second when playing games. The higher the rate, the smoother the motion appears.

## `Display Alignment`

Ensure the perfect alignment of the video contents from multiple displays.
