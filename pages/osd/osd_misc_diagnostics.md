Use the joystick to highlight the **Diagnostics** option and press it to run Built-in Diagnostics. Observe if the screen has any defects or abnormalities. Toggle the joystick again to go to the next screen. The test is complete when a text screen is arrived. Then, toggle the joystick to exit.

If you do not detect any screen abnormalities, check the video card and computer.
