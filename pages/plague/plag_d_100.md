2.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_b1}}">`________(夜色渐浓，已经是晚上了)`</b> when Grand and the doctor <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_b2}}">`________(动身)`</b> at last. The Cottard incident seemed to have shaken the neighborhood out of its normal lethargy and even these remote streets were becoming crowded with noisy merry-makers.

3.  And, with a twinkle in his eye, he took his hat off, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_c1}}">`________(恭敬有礼地向下一挥)`</b>.

4.  There's lot of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_d1}}">`________(精力/活力)`</b> in me yet, and I'll see'em all into their graves.

5.  From the dark harbor soared the first rocket of the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_e1}}">`________(烟花表演)`</b> organized by the municipality, and the town <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_e2}}">`________(发出一声愉悦的长叹，对其赞不绝口)`</b>.

6.  “Oh, for no particular reason. Only—well, he never talked just for talking’s sake. I’d rather <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_f1}}">`________(开始喜欢)`</b> him. But there you are!

7.  And it was in the midst of shouts rolling against the terrace wall in massive waves that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_g1}}">`________(变得更大、持续得更久)`</b>, while cataracts of colored fire <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_g2}}">`________(渐密渐浓，坠入黑夜)`</b> the darkness, that Dr. Rieux resolved to compile this chronicle so that he should not be one of those who hold their peace but should <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_g3}}">`________(挺身作证)`</b> in favor of those plague-stricken people;

8.  He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_h1}}">`________(休眠/潜伏)`</b> for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city.

9.  “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_i1}}">`________(我敢发誓)`</b> And there’ll be speeches.” He chuckled throatily. “I can almost hear them saying: ‘Our dear departed . . .’ And then they’ll go off and have a good snack.”

10.  “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_j1}}">`________(报纸上是这么说的)`</b>. A monument, or just a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.tablet}}">`tablet`</b>.”

11.  “They’re quite right to amuse themselves,” he said. “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_k1}}">`________(世上的人无奇不有)`</b>, as they say. And your colleague, Doctor, how’s he getting on?”

12.  When Rieux was leaving the room, a new thought crossed his mind. “I say, Doctor. Is it a fact they’re going to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_100_l1}}">`________(设立纪念碑)`</b> to the people who died of plague?”
