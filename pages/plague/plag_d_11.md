1.  Cottard was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_a1}}">`________(一个古怪的人)`</b>. For a long while their relations went no farther than wishing each other good-day when they met on the stairs.

2.  Two crisscross strokes, and the ganglion <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.disgorged}}">`disgorged`</b> a mixture of blood and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.pus}}">`pus`</b>. Their limbs stretched out as far as they could manage, the sick men went on bleeding.

3.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_c1}}">`________([用手术刀]划下两条十字线后)`</b>, and the ganglion disgorged a mixture of blood and pus. Their limbs stretched out as far as they could manage, the sick men went on bleeding.

4.  Grand had then explained to him that he was trying to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_d1}}">`________(重温/复习)`</b> his Latin. He’d learned it at school, of course, but his memories had grown blurred.

5.  Rieux gazed down at him for a moment, then assured him that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_e1}}">`________([某事]是不可能的)`</b> anything like that, and in any case he was here to protect his patient.

6.  “As you can guess, we've other things to think about, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_f1}}">`________(因为...由于...)`</b> this fever everybody's thinking about.”

7.  Grand, too, looked tired and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.overwrought}}">`overwrought`</b>; he kept <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_g1}}">`________(在房间里来回走)`</b>, opening and closing a portfolio crammed with sheets of manuscript that lay on the table.

8.  The inspector then asked him peremptorily if he intended to “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_h1}}">`________(再次尝试做这件事)`</b>.” <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_h2}}">`________(激动起来)`</b>, Cottard said certainly not, his one wish was to be left in peace.

9.  No doubt it was the weather. As the day <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_i1}}">`________(流逝)`</b>, everything grew <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_i2}}">`________(棘手)`</b>, and Rieux felt his anxiety increasing after each visit.

10.  “Allow me to point out, my man,” the police officer rejoined with asperity, “that just now it’s you who’re troubling the peace of others.” Rieux signed to him not to continue, and he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_j1}}">`________(停止争论)`</b>.

11.  Cottard replied that all this was quite needless, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_11_k1}}">`________(在他看来)`</b>, and anyhow he didn’t like the police.
