2.  Stupidity <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_b1}}">`________(总是能够随心所欲)`</b>; as we should see if we were not always so much <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_b2}}">`________(关注我们自己)`</b>.

3.  Meanwhile, government and municipal officials were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_c1}}">`________(集体思考/集思广益)`</b>. So long as each individual doctor had come across only two or three cases, no one had thought of taking action.

5.  In fact, like our fellow citizens, Rieux was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_e1}}">`________(让他猝不及防)`</b>, and we should understand his hesitations in the light of this fact; and similarly understand how he was torn between conflicting fears and confidence.

6.  Everybody knows that pestilences <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_f1}}">`________([某事经常会]以某种形式发生)`</b> recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_f2}}">`________(灾难从天而降，大难临头)`</b>.

7.  They went on doing business, arranged for journeys, and formed views. How should they have <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_g1}}">`________(认真考虑某事)`</b> anything like plague, which <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_g2}}">`________(使某事不可能发生，此处意译为毁了我们的未来)`</b> any future, cancels journeys, silences the exchange of views.

8.  “Well, I know. And I don’t need any <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.post-mortems}}">`post-mortems`</b>. I was in China <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_h1}}">`________(职业生活的大部分时间)`</b>, and I saw some cases in Paris twenty years ago.
