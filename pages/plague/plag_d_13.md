1.  Ten thousand dead <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_a1}}">`________(等于/合计为)`</b> about five times the audience in a biggish cinema.

2.  But, again, in the Canton epidemic there was no reliable way of counting up the rats. A very rough estimate was all that could be made, with, obviously, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_b1}}">`________(很容易出差错)`</b>.

3.  He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_c1}}">`________(让自己停止)`</b> sharply. He was letting his imagination <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_c2}}">`________(恶作剧，引申为任凭自己天马行空地想象)`</b>—the last thing wanted just now. A few cases, he told himself, don’t make an epidemic; they merely call for serious precautions.

4.  And, gazing in the direction of the bay, Dr. Rieux <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_d1}}">`________(使回忆起某事)`</b> the plague-fires of which Lucremoutius tells, which the Anthenians kindled on the seashore.

5.  Rieux <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_e1}}">`________(重新振作起来)`</b>.

6.  And since a dead man <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_f2}}">`________(无足轻重)`</b> unless one has actually seen him dead, a hundred million corposes broadcast through history are no more than <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_f1}}">`________(一缕青烟)`</b> in the imagination.

7.  Yes, in conclusion, the patient’s life <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_g1}}">`________(命悬一线)`</b>, and three people out of four (he remembered the exact figures) were too impatient not to make the very slight movement that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_g2}}">`________(啪地一声折断)`</b>.

8.  The doctor was still looking out of the window. Beyond it lay <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_h1}}">`________(凉爽的春天天空的宁静光辉)`</b>; inside the room a word was echoing still, the word “plague.”

9.  Only the sea, murmurous behind the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.dingy}}">`dingy`</b> checkerboard of houses, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_i1}}">`________(述说着)`</b> the unrest, the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.precariousness}}">`precariousness`</b>, of all things in this world.

10.  But these extravagant forebodings dwindled in the light of reason. True, the word “plague” had been uttered; true, at this very moment one or two victims were being seized and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_j1}}">`________(倒下/平卧)`</b> by the disease.

11.  Then the plague would come to an end, because it was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.unthinkable}}">`unthinkable`</b>, or, rather, because one <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_13_k1}}">`________(在误导人的基础上进行思考)`</b>.

12.  There lay <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.certitude}}">`certitude`</b>; there, in the daily round. All the rest hung on mere threads and trivial contingencies; you couldn’t waste your time on it. The thing was to do your job as it should be done.
