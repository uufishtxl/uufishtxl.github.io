1.  He had gone on performing his obscure, ill-paid duties until a somewhat <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_a1}}">`________(年事已高)`</b>.

2.  He could certainly have <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_b1}}">`________(提出正式的主张)`</b>, if not his rights—of which he wasn’t sure—at least the promises given him.

3.  Thus he confirmed the wisdom of an opinion often voiced by our mayor, a business <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.magnate}}">`magnate`</b> of the town, when he insisted vehemently that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_c1}}">`________(最终/归根结底/总之)`</b> (he emphasized this choice expression, which indeed <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_c2}}">`________(常常用在他的辩论里)`</b>) there was no reason to believe that anyone had ever died of hunger in the town.

4.  To be precise, he couldn’t picture <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_d1}}">`________(这样的癖好)`</b> existing in a plague-stricken community, and he concluded that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_d3}}">`________(...的机会很渺茫)`</b> the plague’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_d2}}">`________(取得[艰难的]进展)`</b> among our fellow citizens.

5.  That evening, as he watched Grand’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_e1}}">`________([目送他]离去)`</b>, it <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_e2}}">`________(医生突然意识到)`</b> what it was that Grand was trying to convey; he was evidently writing a book or something of the sort.

6.  According to him, he felt a particular aversion from talking about his “rights”—the word was one that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_f1}}">`________(让人停止)`</b>—and likewise from mentioning a “promise”—which would have implied that he was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_f2}}">`________(要自己应得的[权益])`</b> and thus <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_f3}}">`________(显示出)`</b> an audacity incompatible with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_f4}}">`________(他所从事的卑微的职位)`</b>.

7.  What little he told of his personal life <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_g2}}">`________(保证/担保/证明)`</b> acts of kindness and a capacity for affection that no one in our times dares <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_g1}}">`________(承认)`</b>.

8.  He realized how absurd it was, but he simply couldn’t believe that a pestilence <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_h1}}">`________(大规模的)`</b> could befall a town where people like Grand were to be found, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_h2}}">`________(有着无伤大雅癖好、籍籍无名的公职人员)`</b>.

9.  Also—this, anyhow, was what he told Dr. Rieux—he had come, after long experience, to realize that he could always count on <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_i1}}">`________(量入为出地生活)`</b>; all he had to do was to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_i2}}">`________(按收入比如减少他的需求)`</b>.

10.  Yet to express such emotions, simple as they were, the least word cost him a terrible effort. And this difficulty in <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_j1}}">`________(找不到/说不出[合适的]字眼)`</b> had come to be <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_15_j2}}">`________(他一生的祸根)`</b>.
