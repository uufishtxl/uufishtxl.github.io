1.  “”This particular tobacconist -- a woman, by the way,“ Grand explained, "is a holy <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_a1}}">`________(讨厌鬼)`</b>."

2.  I told Cottard so, but he replied that I was prejudiced and she had plenty of good <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_b1}}">`________(特点/特性/特征)`</b>, only one had to find them out.

3.  But now the only Oran newspaper he bought was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_c1}}">`________(保守党的机关报)`</b>, and one could hardly help suspecting that he made a point of reading it in public places.

4.  He paused; with a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_d1}}">`________(机关枪)`</b> rattle from its <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_d2}}">`________(排气系统)`</b> the “deratization” van was clattering by.

5.  Since his attempt at suicide Cottard had had no more visitors. In the streets, in shops, he was always trying to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_e1}}">`________(建立友谊)`</b>. To the grocer he was all affability; no one could take more pains than he to show his interest in the tobacconist’s gossip.

6.  But <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_f1}}">`________(他的情绪时好时坏)`</b>. One day when the grocer had shown less affability, he came home <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_f2}}">`________(怒不可遏)`</b>.

7.  “I don’t quite know how to put it, but I must say I’ve an impression that he is trying to make himself agreeable to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_g1}}">`________(所有人)`</b>, to be <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_g2}}">`________(受到所有人的欢迎)`</b>.

8.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_h1}}">`________(兴致勃勃的交谈)`</b> was in progress and the woman behind the counter started <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_h2}}">`________(夸夸其谈)`</b> about a murder case that had created some stir in Algiers. A young commercial employee had killed an Arabian on a beach.

9.  Subsequently Grand reported to the doctor other changes in Cottard’s character. Cottard had always professed very liberal ideas, as his <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_i1}}">`________(钟爱的/喜爱的)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.dictum}}">`dictum`</b> on economic questions, “Big fish eat little fish,” implied.

10.  Not long after this he made some curious remarks to Grand in the course of conversation. He had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_j1}}">`________(缠着Grand，让他做某事)`</b> telling him about the somewhat mysterious “private work” to which Grand gave his evenings.

11.  Grand noticed that the staff <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_k1}}">`________(重视/理解)`</b> Cottard and he soon discovered why, when he saw the lavish tips his companion gave. The traveling salesman seemed greatly to appreciate the amiability shown him in return for his <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.largesse}}">`largesse`</b>.

12.  “He’s a man with something pretty serious <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_l1}}">`________(心事重重的 - weighing heavily and guiltily on one's mind)`</b>,” Grand said gravely.

13.  Somewhat <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_m1}}">`________(同数量级的)`</b> was a request he made to Grand shortly before he left his sick-bed; Grand mentioned he was going to the post office and Cottard asked him to be kind enough to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_18_m2}}">`________(发出汇票)`</b> for a hundred francs to a sister living at a distance, mentioning that he sent her this sum every month.
