1.  “I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_a1}}">`________(承认/同意)`</b> you, it’s only my theory. Still, in a sense, that goes for everybody.”

2.  It's about a poor <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_b1}}">`________(有一定特征的人/家伙)`</b> who's arrested one fine morning, all of a sudden.

3.  “Well,” Rieux said, “that depends. In one sense I agree, nobody has the right. But all that’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_c1}}">`________(离题的/不相关的)`</b>. What’s important is for you to go out a bit. It’s a mistake staying indoors too much.”

4.  The engine was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_d1}}">`________([引擎]空转/低速运转)`</b>. Rieux had his hand on the stick. But he was looking again at the boy who was still watching him with an oddly grave intentness. Suddenly, unexpectedly, the child smiled, showing all his teeth.

5.  “There,” Castel said, "I don't agree with you. These little <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_e1}}">`________(令人讨厌的东西)`</b> always have <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_e2}}">`________(有独特之处)`</b>. But, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_e3}}">`________(归根到底)`</b>, it's always the same thing.

6.  But the night was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_f1}}">`________([夜色]加浓)`</b> and it would have been difficult to read in the growing darkness. Most likely Cottard had been sitting musing in the twilight until he heard the ring at his door. Rieux asked how he was feeling.

7.  Nightfall, with its deep, remote baying of unseen ships, the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_g1}}">`________(这里是喧闹/喧嚣的意思)`</b> rising from the sea, and the happy tumult of the crowd—that first hour of darkness which in the past had always had a special charm for Rieux—seemed today <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_g2}}">`________(充满着...)`</b> menace, because of all he knew.

8.  When Rieux said nothing, he went on: “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_19_h1}}">`________(听着/注意/留心)`</b>, that’s not my case. Only I’ve been reading that detective story. It’s about a poor devil who’s arrested one fine morning, all of a sudden.
