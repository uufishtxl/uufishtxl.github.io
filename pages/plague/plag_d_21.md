1.  Indeed, it needed several days for us to realize that we were completely <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_a1}}">`________(被逼入绝境/困住)`</b>; that words like “special arrangements,” “favor,” and “priority” had lost all effective meaning.

2.  The Prefect sent instructions to Rieux, through Richard, asking him to draw up a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_b1}}">`________(备忘录)`</b> to be transmitted for orders to the central administration of the colony. Rieux included in it a clinical diagnosis and statistics of the epidemic.

3.  Thousands of roses wilted in the flower-vender's baskets in the marketplaces and along the streets, and the air was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_c1}}">`________(充满/满载)`</b> their <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.cloying}}">`cloying`</b> perfume.

4.  Moreover, the epidemic seemed to be <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_d1}}">`________(正在减弱)`</b>.

5.  And since, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_e1}}">`________(实际上)`</b>, the phrases one can use in a telegram are quickly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_e2}}">`________(用尽/用完)`</b>, long lives passed side by side, or passionate yearnings, soon declined to the exchange of such trite formulas as: “Am well. Always thinking of you. Love.”

6.  Thus, for example, a feeling normally as individual as the ache of separation from those one loves suddenly became a feeling in which all shared alike and—together with fear—the greatest affliction of the long period of exile that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_f1}}">`________(即将来临)`</b>.

7.  Later on, when these same sentries had had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_g1}}">`________(事态的严重性)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_g2}}">`________(灌输到他们体内)`</b>, they flatly refused to take responsibilities whose possible after-effects they could not foresee.

8.  The telegram <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_h1}}">`________(写道)`</b>: Proclaim a state of plague stop close the town.

9.  So we had to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_i1}}">`________(退到/求助于)`</b> telegrams. People linked together by friendship, affection, or physical love found themselves reduced to hunting for tokens of their past communion <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_i2}}">`________(在...的范围内)`</b> a ten-word telegram.

10.  In the evening the usual crowd <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_j1}}">`________(涌上街头)`</b> and the lines lengthened outside the picture-houses. Moreover, the epidemic seemed to be on the wane; on some days only ten or so deaths were notified.

11.  Cottard <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_21_k1}}">`________(仍然过着他那散漫的生活)`</b>, and M. Othon, the magistrate, continued to parade his menagerie.
