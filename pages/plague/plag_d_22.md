1.  Some families—actually very few—refused to take the position seriously and in their eagerness to have the absent members of the family with them again, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_a1}}">`________(将谨慎行事当作了耳旁风)`</b> and wired to them to take this opportunity of returning.

2.  And for every one of us the ruling emotion of his life—which he had imagined he knew <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_b1}}">`________(彻底/完全)`</b> (the people of Oran, as has been said, have simple passions)—<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_b2}}">`________(换上了一副全新的面貌)`</b>.

3.  It was undoubtedly the feeling of exile—that sensation of a void within which never left us, that irrational longing to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_c1}}">`________(to turn back to an earlier topic or circumstance)`</b> to the past or else to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_c2}}">`________(加快时间向前迈进的速度)`</b>, and those <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_c3}}">`________(由回忆构成的利箭)`</b> that stung like fire.

4.  Sometimes we <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_d1}}">`________(用我们的想象力来取乐)`</b>, composing ourselves to wait for a ring at the bell announcing somebody’s return, or for the sound of a familiar footstep on the stairs;

5.  And the narrator is convinced that he can set down here, as <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_e1}}">`________(对...真实/有效)`</b> all, the feeling he personally had and to which many of his friends confessed.

6.  This drastic, clean-cut deprivation and our complete ignorance of what the future <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_f1}}">`________(有...等待着/保留着)`</b> had taken us unawares; we were unable to react against the mute appeal of presences, still so near and already so far, which haunted us daylong.

7.  Sons who had lived beside their mothers hardly giving them a glance <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_g1}}">`________(着手做某事)`</b> picturing with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.poignant}}">`poignant`</b> regret each wrinkle in the absent face that memory cast upon the screen.

8.  But this ruthless, protracted separation enabled them to realize that they could not live apart, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_h1}}">`________(在这一突然发现的光辉中)`</b> the risk of plague seemed insignificant.

9.  They weren’t one of those exemplary married couples of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_i1}}">`________(模范型夫妻)`</b>; on the contrary, the narrator <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_22_i2}}">`________(有理由说某事)`</b> saying that, in all probability, neither partner felt quite sure the marriage was all that could have been desired.
