1.  ...bent as they were on cherishing the all-too-real phantoms of their imagination and conjuring up with all their might pictures of a land where <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_23_a1}}">`________(一种特别的光束的闪烁)`</b>, two or three hills, a favorite tree, a woman’s smile, composed for them a world that nothing could replace.

2.  What first <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_23_b1}}">`________(使他们完全意识到)`</b> was the trouble they experienced in summoning up any clear picture of what the absent one was doing.

3.  Hostile to the past, impatient of the present, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_23_c1}}">`________(对未来感到失望)`</b>, we were much like those whom men's justice, or hatred, forces to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_23_c2}}">`________(在铁窗中度日)`</b>.

4.  And they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_23_d1}}">`________(加深/加强)`</b> their despondency with fleeting intimations, messages as disconcerting as a flight of swallows, a dew-fall at sundown, or those queer <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.glints}}">`glints`</b> the sun sometimes dapples on empty streets.

6.  when they had drunk in advance the dregs of bitterness of those six black months, and painfully screwed up their courage to the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_23_f2}}">`________(顶点)`</b>, straining all their remaining energy to endure valiantly the long ordeal of all those weeks and days.

7.  Thus, in a middle course between these heights and depths, they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_23_g1}}">`________(汲取到力量)`</b> only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress.
