1.  “He died in the hospital. There’s no money in plague, that’s sure.” Cottard was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_a1}}">`________(满脑子都是这样的故事)`</b> of this kind, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_a2}}">`________(真假掺杂)`</b>, about the epidemic.

2.  Jeanne was so tiny that it always made Grand nervous to see her crossing a street, the vehicles <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_b1}}">`________(向...逼近/冲向)`</b> looked so gigantic.

3.  Owing largely to fatigue, he gradually <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_c1}}">`________(变得无法认清自己的处境/失去控制自己处境的能力)`</b>, had less and less to say, and failed to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_c2}}">`________(让她妻子相信自己爱意依旧)`</b>.

4.  “Forgive me, Doctor,” Grand added hastily, “but—how shall I put it?—I feel you’re to be trusted. That’s why I can talk to you about these things. And then, you see, I get all <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_d1}}">`________(非常不安/激动)`</b>.”

5.  They walked a little way together. Cottard told the story of a grocer in his street who had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_e1}}">`________(储备供将来之用/囤积物品)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_e2}}">`________(大量)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_e3}}">`________(罐装食品)`</b> with the idea of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_e4}}">`________(之后卖高价)`</b>.

6.  Grand produced from his pocket something that looked like <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_f1}}">`________(一张格子手帕)`</b> and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_f2}}">`________(擤鼻子)`</b> noisily.

7.  Obviously Grand’s thoughts were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_g1}}">`________(十万八千里之外)`</b> the plague.

8.  Neither he nor Jeanne ever <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_h1}}">`________(离开/走出来)`</b> their part of the town. In his courting days he used to go to see her at her home, and the family were inclined to make fun of her bashful, silent admirer. Her father was a railroad man.

9.  “Good for him!” was Cottard’s comment. But his next remark seemed to belie his gleeful exclamation. “Anyhow, we’ll all be nuts <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_26_i1}}">`________(不久之后)`</b>, unless I’m much mistaken.”
