1.  Yes, an element of abstraction, of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_a1}}">`________(与现实的分离)`</b>, entered into such calamities. Still when abstraction <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_a2}}">`________(开始做某事)`</b> killing you, you’ve got to get busy with it.

2.  And so much Rieux knew: that this wasn't the easiest <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_b1}}">`________(行为/做法)`</b>.

3.  “Please don’t doubt I understand you,” Rieux said, “but you must see your argument doesn’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_c1}}">`________([论点或理论]符合逻辑/站得住脚)`</b>. I can’t give you that certificate because I don’t know whether you have the disease or not."

4.  Rieux asked him to let him know how he got on with his project, and not to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_d1}}">`________(心怀怨恨)`</b> for not having been more amenable. He was sure, he added, that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_d2}}">`________(在某些方面他们是能够达成一致的)`</b>. Rambert looked perplexed.

5.  “Because there are thousands of people <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_e1}}">`________(有着和你一样的处境)`</b> are in this town, and there can’t be any question of allowing them to leave it.”

6.  But was he right in reproaching him, Rieux, with living in a world of abstractions? Could that term “abstraction” really apply to these days he spent in his hospital while the plague was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_f1}}">`________(靠别人养肥自己[贬义])`</b> the town, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_f2}}">`________(将死亡人数提升至500)`</b> a week?

7.  The journalist <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_g1}}">`________(拉紧领带)`</b>.

8.  Rieux was silent for a moment, then said he understood it perfectly. He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_28_h1}}">`________(非常希望某事发生)`</b> that Rambert should be allowed to return to his wife and that all who loved one another and were parted should come together again.
