1.  He started walking again. Grand looked abashed, then stepped forward and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_a1}}">`________(跟了上来)`</b>.

2.  Rieux was already halfway down the stairs, and when he stepped out into the street, two men <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_b1}}">`________(和他擦身而过)`</b>.

3.  But, of course, one never can tell, and Rieux preferred to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_c1}}">`________(保持缄默)`</b>. Try as he might to shut his ears to it, he still was listening to that eerie sound above, the whispering of the plague.

4.  "Yes," Rieux said, "<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_d1}}">`________(我明白你的意思)`</b>."

5.  G<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_e1}}">`________(达到[特定水平/数量])`</b>d went on talking, but Rieux failed to follow all the worthy man was saying. All he gathered was that the work he was engaged on ran to a great many pages, and he was at almost <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.excruciating}}">`excruciating`</b> pains to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_e2}}">`________(完善它)`</b>.

6.  At that moment he had a preternaturally vivid awareness of the town stretched out below, a victim world secluded and apart, and of the groans of agony stifled in its darkness. Then, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_f1}}">`________(声音低沉而清晰)`</b>, Grand’s voice came to his ears.

7.  For though it sometimes satisfied him, he was fully aware it didn’t quite <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_g1}}">`________(达到目的)`</b> as yet, and also that to some extent it <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_g2}}">`________(虽说程度不重，但是笔调多少也有点陈腔滥调的意味)`</b>.

8.  “No, don’t look,” Grand said. “It’s my <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_h1}}">`________(开篇语)`</b>, and it’s giving trouble, no end of trouble.”

9.  They had reached the part of the town where Grand lived and, as it was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_i1}}">`________(地势比较高)`</b>, they felt <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_34_i2}}">`________(凉爽的夜风吹拂着他们的脸庞)`</b> and at the same time carrying away from them the noises of the town.
