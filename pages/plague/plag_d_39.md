1.  A small fixed income had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_a1}}">`________(让他活到了现在的岁数)`</b>, seventy-five, and the years had not <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_a2}}">`________(压制[情感]/控制[情感])`</b> his cheerfulness.

2.  He couldn’t bear the sight of a watch, and indeed there wasn’t one in the whole house. “Watches,” he said, “are silly gadgets, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_b1}}">`________(昂贵)`</b> at that.”

3.  What <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_c2}}">`________(完成描述)`</b> of the old man was a desire he expressed several times, and which seemed deeply rooted: the desire to die <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_c1}}">`________(在高龄)`</b>.

4.  He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_d1}}">`________(开始待在床上)`</b> and never left it again -- but not because of his asthma, which would not have prevented his getting about.

5.  That priest's right; we were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_e1}}">`________(罪有应得/自讨苦吃)`</b>.

6.  “At daybreak <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_f1}}">`________(微风)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_f2}}">`________(吹拂)`</b> the still empty streets. At this hour, between the night’s victims and the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_f3}}">`________(死亡的折磨)`</b> of the coming day, it is as if for a while plague <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_f4}}">`________(住手/不做某事)`</b> and takes breath.

7.  “Ah, here’s another of ’em!” he exclaimed when he saw Tarrou. “It’s a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_g1}}">`________(混乱的/乱七八糟的)`</b> world <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_g2}}">`________(确实/的确)`</b>, more doctors than patients.

8.  “Because it’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_h1}}">`________(杀死/撂倒他们)`</b>, ain’t it, more and more. That priest’s right; we were asking for it.” Next day Tarrou came to see him without warning.

9.  He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_i1}}">`________(算出)`</b> the time—that is to say, the time for meals—with his two saucepans, one of which was always full of peas when he woke in the morning.

10.  From Tarrou’s notes we gather that the old man, a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_j1}}">`________(干货)`</b> dealer by occupation, decided at the age of fifty that he’d done enough work for a lifetime.

11.  He filled the other, pea by pea, at a constant, carefully regulated speed. Thus time for him was reckoned by these pans and he could <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_k1}}">`________(判明方向/观望形势/弄清自己所处的地位)`</b> in it at any moment of the day.

12.  According to religion, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_l1}}">`________(人的前半生好比上坡路，后半生则一路向下)`</b>. On the descending days he had no claim, they may be snatched from him at any moment;

13.  “Soon, awakened by the early streetcars, they will <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_39_m1}}">`________(成扇形散开)`</b> through the town, holding at arm’s length sheets on which the word PLAGUE looms large.
