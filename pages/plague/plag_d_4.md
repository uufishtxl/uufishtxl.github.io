5.  Rieux asked him how he felt. The concierge wouldn’t go so far as to say he was feeling ill. Still <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_4_e1}}">`________(他觉得不太舒服)`</b>.

6.  “Very odd,” Rieux agreed, “and it ends by <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_4_f1}}">`________(让人觉得很烦扰)`</b>.”

7.  “No,” Rieux said quietly, they weren’t so bad as that. He had put the question solely to find out if Rambert could or couldn’t state the facts without <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_4_g1}}">`________(混淆事实)`</b>.
