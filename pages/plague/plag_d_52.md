1.  Tarrou, who was gazing amiably at Cottard, said he knew the latest figures, and that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_a1}}">`________(状况非常严峻)`</b>.

2.  Cottard stared at him in a puzzled manner, and Tarrou went on to say that there were far too many <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_b1}}">`________(消极懈怠的人)`</b>, that this plague was everybody’s business, and everyone should do his duty. For instance, any able-bodied man was welcome in the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_b2}}">`________(卫生小组)`</b>.

3.  “Prison or <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_c1}}">`________(流放你去服苦役)`</b>?”

4.  “That’s an idea,” said Cottard, “but it won’t get you anywhere. The plague <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_d1}}">`________(有鞭子在手，表示比其他相关人士更有权力，能够控制别人)`</b> and there’s nothing to be done about it.”

5.  “The only thing to do is to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_e1}}">`________([活动中断后]继续下去)`</b> again where I dropped it.”

6.  “That’s impossible, since he recovered. You know as well as I do, once you have plague <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_f1}}">`________(你就必死无疑/大限将至了)`</b>.”

7.  And I can't bear the idea of being <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_g1}}">`________(逮捕)`</b> for that, being torn from my home and habits and everyone I know.

8.  But at this same moment, now that once more all ways of escape were sealed against him, he felt <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_h1}}">`________(又一次燃起一股对她的渴望)`</b>, with a violence so sudden, so intense,

9.  Losing all control of himself, Cottard let out <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_i1}}">`________(一连串)`</b> oaths.

10.  “Don’t get excited,” Tarrou said quietly. “Neither I nor the doctor would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_j1}}">`________(幻想/考虑/想要做某事)`</b>reporting you to the police. What you may have done is no business of ours. And, anyway, we’ve never had much use for the police. Come, now! Sit down again.”

11.  “It’s something that happened ages ago,” he began. “Somehow they’ve <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_k1}}">`________(发现/查明了事情)`</b>. I thought it had all been forgotten. But somebody started talking, damn him!

12.  Then he seemed to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_l1}}">`________(鼓起勇气)`</b> again and when Rambert entered was shouting almost aggressively: "What's more, I'm pretty sure you won't <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_l2}}">`________([在鼠疫问题上]取得进展/成果/)`</b>."

13.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.Twiddling}}">`Twiddling`</b> his hat uneasily, Cottard gazed at Tarrou with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_m1}}">`________(躲躲闪闪的眼神)`</b>.

14.  “And is that the reason,” Tarrou asked, “why you had the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_n1}}">`________(聪明的点子)`</b> of hanging yourself?”

15.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_o1}}">`________(好像有个新点子突然袭上心头似的)`</b>, Tarrou struck his forehead.

16.  “No. But every person in the town must <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_p1}}">`________(将这些实践到自己身上)`</b>.”

17.  “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_q1}}">`________(这件事十有八九不可能)`</b>,” Tarrou commented. “He was in luck.”
