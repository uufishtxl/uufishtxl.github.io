1.  Rambert learned <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_a1}}">`________(让他倍感失望的是)`</b> that Cottard didn’t know where Gonzales lived; he suggested that they’d better pay another visit to the small café. They made an appointment for the following day.

2.  Next morning Cottard and Rambert went off to the cafe and left a message for Garcia, asking him to come that evening, or if this could not be <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_b1}}">`________(可以安排出[时间]来参加)`</b>, next day.

3.  “Tomorrow evening,” Gonzales continued, “we’ll look up the kids and try to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_c1}}">`________(抓紧时间，真正行动起来)`</b>.”

4.  “Courage. I know now that man is capable of great deeds. But if he isn’t capable of a great emotion, well, he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_d1}}">`________(未能打动某人/提不起某人的兴趣)`</b>.”

5.  When Rieux <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_e1}}">`________(告诉/告知/通知他)`</b> that he’d like to be <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_e2}}">`________(让他了解最新消息)`</b>, Rambert proposed that he and Tarrou should <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_e3}}">`________(联系/寻找他)`</b> one night at the end of the week.

6.  Quite possibly Gonzales and the two youngsters hadn’t been able to get through the cordon. All he could do was to put them in touch once more with Raoul. Naturally this couldn’t be done before <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_f1}}">`________(后天)`</b>.

7.  “A dog or a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_g1}}">`________(逃犯)`</b>,” Tarrou remarked.

8.  “You know, Doctor, I’ve given a lot of thought to your campaign. And if I’m not with you, I have my reasons. No, I don’t think it’s that I’m afraid to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_h1}}">`________(冒着生命危险)`</b> again. I took part in the Spanish Civil War.”

9.  On the next day but one, Raoul, whom Rambert met at a street corner, confirmed Garcia’s surmise; the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_i1}}">`________(低洼地区)`</b> had, in fact, been isolated and a cordon put round them.

10.  “Rather a boring record,” Rambert remarked. “And this must be the tenth time I’ve <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_j1}}">`________(放[唱片])`</b> today.”
