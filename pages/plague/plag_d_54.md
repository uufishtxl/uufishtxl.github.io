1.  Hither to the plague had found far more victims in the more thickly populated and less <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_54_a1}}">`________(陈设得当)`</b> outer districts than in the heart of the town.

2.  Man is an idea, and a precious small ideea, once he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_54_b1}}">`________(备齐/抛弃)`</b> love.

8.  I suppose <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_54_h1}}">`________(没有牵挂和羁绊)`</b> in all this.

9.  It was at this time that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_54_i1}}">`________(大风)`</b> rose and blew for several days through the plague-stricken city.

10.  With the result that for several days when twilight came—it fell much quicker at this time of the year—the streets were almost empty, and silent <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_54_j1}}">`________(except for)`</b> the long-drawn stridence of the wind.
