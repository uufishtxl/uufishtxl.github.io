1.  It cannot be denied that, anyhow in the early days, the natural feelings of the family were somewhat outraged by these <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_a1}}">`________(闪电般的)`</b> funerals.

2.  Actually the most striking feature of our funerals was their speed. Formalities had been <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_b1}}">`________(逐渐减少/缩减)`</b>, and, generally speaking, all elaborate ceremonial suppressed.

3.  Next the coffin was loaded on a motor-vehicle—a real <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_c1}}">`________(灵车)`</b> or a large converted ambulance. The mourners stepped into one of the few taxis still allowed to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.ply}}">`ply`</b> and the vehicles drove <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_c2}}">`________(尽快)`</b> to the cemetery <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_c3}}">`________(走某条路线)`</b> avoiding the center of the town.

5.  In lifeless squares and avenues these <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.tawdry}}">`tawdry`</b> idols <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_e1}}">`________(对...作威作福，这里理解为高高居于宝座之上)`</b> under the lowering sky; stolid monsters that might have <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.personified}}">`personified`</b> the rule of immobility imposed on us.

6.  Indeed, had not the epidemic, as already mentioned, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_f1}}">`________(延伸破坏性)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_f2}}">`________(一切都会很好)`</b>.

7.  The ambulance had already left and was being sprayed with disinfectant, and while spadefuls of clay thudded more and more dully on the rising layer of earth, the family were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_g1}}">`________(挤进[某个空间])`</b> the taxi.
