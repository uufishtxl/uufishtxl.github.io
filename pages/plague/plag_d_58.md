By a special urgency measure the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.denizens}}">`denizens`</b> of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_58_d3}}">`________(永恒的馈赠，委婉地表示死亡)`</b> were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.evicted}}">`evicted`</b> from their graves and the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.exhumed}}">`exhumed`</b> remains dispatched to the crematorium. And soon the plague victims likewise had to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_58_d2}}">`________(最终只能被火化)`</b>.

5.  Thereafter only when a strong wind was blowing did a faint, sickly odor coming from the east remind them that they were living under a new order and that the plague fires were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_58_e1}}">`________(每天晚上都在造成破坏[意译为焚烧尸体])`</b>.

The corpses were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_58_g1}}">`________(倾倒)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.pell-mell}}">`pell-mell`</b> into the pits and had hardly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_58_g2}}">`________(停止晃动/稳稳地落地)`</b> when spadefuls of quicklime began to sear their faces and the earth covered them indistinctively, in holes dug steadily deeper as time went on.
