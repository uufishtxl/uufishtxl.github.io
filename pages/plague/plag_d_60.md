1.  Meanwhile they drank their beer, nursed their sick, idled, or <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_a1}}">`________(忙于工作)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_a2}}">`________(整理归档文件)`</b> in offices, or played the phonograph at home, without betraying any difference from the rest of us.

2.  Everything was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_b1}}">`________(忍受/容忍)`</b> as it came.

3.  Or when, quite unexpectedly, by some kindly chance, they felt a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.twinge}}">`twinge`</b> of jealousy, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_c1}}">`________(即使这种强烈的情绪毫无目的)`</b>.

4.  So completely were they dominated by the plague that sometimes the one thing they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_d1}}">`________(渴望)`</b> was the long sleep it brought, and they caught themselves thinking: "A good thing if I get plague and have <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_d2}}">`________(因为病情长睡不起)`</b>!"

5.  Now, on the other hand, they took an interest only in what interested everyone else, they had only general ideas, and even their tenderest affections now seemed abstract, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_e1}}">`________(普通、没有多大意义的东西)`</b>.

6.  What with the gunshots echoing at the gates, the punctual thuds of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_f1}}">`________(印章)`</b> making the rhythm of lives and deaths, the files and fires, the panics and formalities, all alike were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_f2}}">`________(被许诺或是注定会)`</b> an ugly but recorded death, and, amidst <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.noxious}}">`noxious`</b> fumes and the muted clang of ambulances, all of us <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_f3}}">`________(共饮流放这一杯苦酒)`</b>, unconsciously waiting for the same reunion, the same miracle of peace regained.

7.  No doubt our love persisted, but in practice it served nothing; it was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_g1}}">`________(我们体内没有活力的物质)`</b>.

8.  And, finally, it is worth noting that those who were parted ceased to enjoy the curious privilege that had been theirs <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_h1}}">`________(开始/起初)`</b>. They had lost love’s egoism and the benefit they derived from it.

9.  In other words, they had ceased to choose for themselves; plague had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_i1}}">`________(把...弄平/持平/达到平衡)`</b> discrimination. This could be seen by the way nobody <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_i2}}">`________(为...操心)`</b> the quality of the clothes or food he bought.

10.  The town was peopled with sleepwalkers, whose <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.trance-}}">`trance`</b>was broken only on the rare occasions when at night their wounds, to all appearance closed, suddenly reopened.

11.  However, this account of our predicament <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_60_k1}}">`________(只给出了大致的轮廓)`</b>.
