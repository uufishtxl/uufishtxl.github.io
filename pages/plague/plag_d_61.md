1.  Throughout September and October the town <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_a1}}">`________(一蹶不振)`</b>, at the mercy of the plague.

2.  Mist, heat, and rain <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_b1}}">`________(改变/改善/推出新花样 [意译为轮番上场、不听变化])`</b> in our streets.

3.  Tarrou <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_c1}}">`________([面对攻击/反对等]顶住/坚持住)`</b> better, but the entries in his diary show that while his curiosity had kept its depth, it had lost its diversity.

4.  From the south came silent coveys of starlings and thrushes, flying very high, but always <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_d1}}">`________(对小镇敬而远之)`</b>, as though the strange implement of the plague described by Paneloux, the giant flail whirling and shrilling over the house tops, warned them off us.

5.  When told of some <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_e1}}">`________(意想不到的)`</b> recovery, they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_e2}}">`________(装作感兴趣的样子)`</b>, but actually received the news with the stolid indifference.

6.  One could see that the strain was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_f1}}">`________(在...身上产生效果/发生影响[负面影响])`</b> him, and if he managed to keep going, it was thanks to two or three fixed ideas.

7.  He had kept the news to himself so far and could only <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_g1}}">`________(把...归因于)`</b> his nervous exhaustion that he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_g2}}">`________(向 Grand 谈起这件事来)`</b>.

8.  As for the others, working themselves almost to a standstill throughout the day and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_h1}}">`________(到深夜)`</b>, they never bothered to read a newspaper or listen to the radio.
