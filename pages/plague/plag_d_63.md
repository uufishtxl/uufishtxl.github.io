1.  Under the heading "Cottard and his Relations with the Plague,"  we find a series of notes <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_a1}}">`________(包含/涉及)`</b> several pages and, in the narrator's opinion, these are well worth summarizing here.

2.  “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_b1}}">`________(实际上/事实上)`</b>, we have no police nowadays; no crimes past or present, no more criminals—only <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_b2}}">`________(被判了刑的人)`</b> hoping for the most capricious of pardons; and among these are the police themselves.”

3.  “In short, this epidemic has <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_c1}}">`________(做令自己风光或骄傲的事，意译为鼠疫是他感到风光)`</b>. Of a lonely man who hated loneliness it has made an accomplice. Yes, ‘accomplice’ is the word that fits, and doesn’t he relish his complicity!

4.  “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_d1}}">`________(尽管说吧)`</b>, my friends—but I had it first!”

5.  “Of course I see his point, and I understand how <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.congenial}}">`congenial`</b> our present mode of life must be to him. How could he fail to recognize <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_e1}}">`________(处处/事事/每次)`</b> reactions that were his; the efforts everyone makes to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_e2}}">`________(避免得罪其他人/争取其他人的好感)`</b>; the obligingness sometimes shown in helping someone who has lost his way, and the ill humor shown at other times...

6.  “And I should say that when tempted to visit a brothel he refrains; it might give him a bad name and be <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_f1}}">`________(会对他不利)`</b> one day.

7.  “And a moment later he added: ‘Say what you like, Tarrou, but let me tell you this: the one way of making people <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_g1}}">`________(相互支持/互相帮助/同心协力)`</b> is to give ’em <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_g2}}">`________(一段短暂时间/一阵)`</b> plague. You’ve only got to look around you.’

8.  He is happily at one with all around him, with their superstitions, their groundless panics, the susceptibilities of people whose nerves are always <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_h1}}">`________(处于紧张状态)`</b>.

9.  ...and, lastly, with their <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.frayed}}">`frayed`</b>, irritable sensibility that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_i1}}">`________(对...生气/因...见怪)`</b> trifling <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.oversights}}">`oversights`</b> and brings tears to their eyes over the loss of a trouser-button.

10.  ‘In fact, one might go farther; have you ever heard of a man with cancer being killed in an <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_j1}}">`________(车祸)`</b>?’ This theory, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_j2}}">`________(无论如何/无论怎么样)`</b>, keeps Cottard cheerful.

11.  This may explain why the entries in Tarrou’s diary of this period tend to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_k1}}">`________(集中于)`</b> Cottard’s personality.

12.  It is obvious that Tarrou was attempting to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_l1}}">`________(给...全面的描述)`</b> the man and noted all his reactions and reflections, whether as conveyed to him by Cottard or interpreted by himself.

13.  For Cottard <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_m1}}">`________(完全没因为...不安)`</b> by <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_m2}}">`________(事情的转变)`</b>. Sometimes in Tarrou’s company he voiced his true feelings in remarks of this order: “Getting worse every day, isn’t it? Well, anyhow, everyone’s in the same boat.”

14.  “Cottard has been through all that obviously—with one exception; we may rule out women in his case. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_n1}}">`________(可能是说傻瓜的意思，不确定)`</b>
