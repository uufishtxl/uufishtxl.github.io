1.  It was the evening before; on leaving the bar he had an impression that his groin was swollen and he had pains in his armpits when he moved his arms. “<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plague_d_66_a1}}">`________(肯定会经历/注定遭受)`</b>!” he thought.

2.  Perhaps because I, too, would like to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plague_d_66_b1}}">`________(尽微薄之力)`</b> for happiness.

3.  During that fortnight Rambert worked <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.indefatigably}}">`indefatigably`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plague_d_66_c1}}">`________(用[最后]全部的勇气/精力/力量等)`</b>, with his eyes shut, as it were, from dawn till night.

4.  On returning home and failing to discover any symptoms of plague on his body, he had felt far from proud of having <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plague_d_66_d1}}">`________([尤指]在很大的压力下坍塌/垮掉)`</b> like that.

5.  They'd <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plague_d_66_e1}}">`________(安排)`</b> the final details in the course of the night, and he could count on them to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plague_d_66_e2}}">`________([艰难地]坚持做完)`</b>.

6.  Rieux shook his head with his usual <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.deliberateness}}">`deliberateness`</b>. It was none of his business, he said. Rambert had elected for happiness, and he, Rieux, had no argument to put up against him.

7.  She was a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.dried-up}}">`dried-up`</b> little wisp of a woman, always dressed in black, busy as a bee, and she had a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.nut-brown}}">`nut-brown`</b>, wrinkled face and immaculately white hair.<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plague_d_66_g1}}">`________(话不多)`</b>, she merely smiled genially when her eyes fell on Rambert.

8.  The next day was very hot and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.muggy}}">`muggy`</b> and a heat-mist veiled the sun. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plague_d_66_h1}}">`________(死亡人数飙升)`</b>. But the old Spanish woman lost nothing of her serenity. “There’s so much wickedness in the world,” she said. “So what can you expect?”
