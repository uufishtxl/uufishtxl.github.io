1.  "Move on, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_a1}}">`________(在直接对话中指非特定的人)`</b>!" a police sergeant with bulging eyes<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.bawl}}">` bawl`</b>ed every few minutes.

2.  Presently Rieux straightened up, dropped his instruments into a tray that an attendant held out to him, and remained without moving for some moments, gazing down at the man, whose wound was now being <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_b1}}">`________(包扎[伤口])`</b>.

3.  A minute or so later Rambert and Rieux were sitting at the back of the doctor’s car. Tarrou, who was at the wheel, looked round as he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_c1}}">`________(挂档)`</b>.

4.  “Gas is running out,” he said. “We’ll have to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_d1}}">`________(在泥泞中费劲地步行)`</b> it tomorrow.”

5.  Tarrow was sitting at a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_e1}}">`________(黑檀木)`</b> desk, with his sleeves rolled up, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_e2}}">`________(擦拭)`</b> with his hankerchief <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_e3}}">`________(一滴汗珠)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_e4}}">`________(臂弯里)`</b>.

6.  “It’s not that.” Rambert <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_f1}}">`________(结结巴巴)`</b> and broke off.

7.  Groans shrill or stifled rose <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_g1}}">`________(从四处)`</b>, blending in a monotonous <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.dirgelike}}">`dirgelike`</b> refrain.

8.  “Paneloux is prepared to replace Rambert at the quarantine station. He has <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_h1}}">`________(花费[大量的时间或精力])`</b> a lot of useful work already. All that remains is to reorganize group number three, now that Rambert’s going.”

9.  “Castel has his first lot of serum ready now,” Tarrou continued. “He’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_i1}}">`________(支持/赞成)`</b> its being tried at once.”

10.  He laid a little sheaf of cards on Tarrou’s desk and, his voice coming thickly through the cloth, said: “Six,” then went out. Tarrou looked at the journalist and showed him the cards, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_j1}}">`________(将他们呈扇形展开)`</b>.

11.  Rambert gazed thoughtfully at Tarrou. He’d grown thinner, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_k1}}">`________(他的眼睛和面容因疲劳而变得模糊不清)`</b>, his broad shoulders sagged. There was a knock at the door. A male attendant, wearing a white mask, entered.

12.  Rambert went to the doctor’s apartment. Rieux’s mother told him he would find the doctor at the hospital in the upper town. As before, a crowd was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_l1}}">`________(围成一圈)`</b> in front of the entrance gates.
