1.  In the early days a mere formality, quarantine had now been reorganized by Rieux and Rambert <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_69_a1}}">`________(以非常严格的方式)`</b>. In particular they insisted on having members of the family of a patient kept apart.

3.

4.  When the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_69_d2}}">`________([剧痛或不愉快的情感的]阵法/迸发)`</b> had passed, utterly exhausted, tensing his thin legs and arms, on which, within forty-eight hours, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_69_d1}}">`________(瘦成皮包骨)`</b>, the child lay flat, racked on the tumbled bed, in a grotesque <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.parody}}">`parody`</b> of crucifixion.

5.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_69_e1}}">`________(站在隔壁床的脚边)`</b>, he took a package of cigarettes from his pocket. But after his first glance at the child’s face he put it back.

6.  Tarrou’s bulky form was slightly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_69_f1}}">`________([身躯]耷拉着)`</b> at the head of the bed, while at its foot, with Rieux standing beside him, Castel was seated, reading, with every appearance of calm, an old leather-bound book.

Tiny, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_69_h2}}">`________(半大)`</b>, but acutely painful buboes were clogging the joints of the child’s puny limbs. Obviously it was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_69_h3}}">`________(一场注定失败的战役)`</b>.

9.  Mme. Othon and her little girl could be given rooms in the quarantine hospital <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_69_i1}}">`________(在 Rambert 管辖下的)`</b>.

10.  Rieux explained this to the magistrate, who <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_69_j1}}">`________(示意同意)`</b> of the procedure. Nevertheless, he and his wife exchanged a glance that made it clear to Rieux how keenly they both felt the separation thus imposed on them.
