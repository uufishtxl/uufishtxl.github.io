1.  Slowly everyone <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_a1}}">`________(排成纵队离开了看台)`</b> and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_a2}}">`________(拖着步子走)`</b> toward the tents. After all were under canvas two small electric trucks, of the kind used for transporting baggage on railroad platforms, began to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.wend}}">`wend`</b> their way between the tents.

2.  While the occupants <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_b1}}">`________(伸出)`</b> their arms, two ladles <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_b3}}">`________(伸进)`</b> the two big caldrons on each truck and neatly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_b2}}">`________(舀出)`</b> their contents into the waiting <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_b4}}">`________(餐盒)`</b>. Then the truck moved on to the next tent.

3.  Soon after, when the camp manager was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_c1}}">`________(送 Tarrou 和 Rambert 出去)`</b>, they heard a crackling noise coming from the stands.

4.  As November <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_d1}}">`________(结束/终止)`</b>, the mornings truned much colder.

5.  M. Othon appeared very tired and not once did he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_e1}}">`________(正视来访者)`</b>.

6.  They <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_f1}}">`________(顺路拜访/顺路探望)`</b> at the office to say good-by to Gonzales, whom they found studying the duty roster. The footballer was laughing when he shook hands with them.

7.  This much, however, he can say; the mere existence of these camps, the smell of crowded humanity coming from them, the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.baying}}">`baying`</b> of their loud-speakers in the dusk, the air of mystery that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_g2}}">`________(缠着他们)`</b>, and the dread these forbidden places inspired <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_g3}}">`________(严重影响)`</b> our fellow citizens’ morale and added to the general nervousness and apprehension. Breaches of the peace and minor riots became more frequent.

8.  He launched into a long <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.harangue}}">`harangue`</b> to the effect that some folks were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_h1}}">`________(养活自己)`</b>, that it was always the same people had all the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_h3}}">`________(肥差)`</b>, and things couldn’t go on like that indefinitely, one day there’d be—he rubbed his hands—“<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_h2}}">`________(出大乱子)`</b>.” He continued expatiating on this theme all the time the doctor was attending to him.

9.  This was the first time Tarrou heard him utter his son’s name, and he realized that something had changed. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_79_i1}}">`________(太阳下山了)`</b> and, flooding through a rift in the clouds, the level rays raked the stands, tingeing their faces with a yellow glow.
