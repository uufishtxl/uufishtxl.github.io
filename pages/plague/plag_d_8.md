1.  Good-humored, always <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_a1}}">`________(面带微笑)`</b>, he seemed <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_a2}}">`________(喜欢一切正当的娱乐却不沉迷其中)`</b>.

2.  He had a soldierly bearing, very erect, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_b1}}">`________(喜欢/具有或标示...的喜好)`</b> a military style of dressing; his snow-white hair was always brushed to perfect smoothness.

3.  “I wouldn’t say that. He had a weak chest and he used to play the trombone in the town band. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_c1}}">`________(对肺不好)`</b>, blowing a trombone.”

4.  His room at the hotel <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_d1}}">`________(面向/朝向...)`</b> a small side street and there were always several cats sleeping in the shadow of the walls.

5.  In fact, the only habit he was known to have was that of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_e1}}">`________(结交)`</b> of the Spanish dancers and musicians who abound in our town.

6.  But an unusual type of chronicle, since the writer seems to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_f2}}">`________(特意/故意做某事)`</b> understatement, and at first sight we might almost imagine that Tarrou had a habit of observing events and people <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_f1}}">`________(从望远镜的另一端[观察事物])`</b>.

7.  All the same, it is undeniable that these notebooks, which form a sort of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_g1}}">`________(散文一样的日记)`</b>, supply the chronicler of the period with <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_g2}}">`________(大量/许多)`</b> seemingly trivial details which yet have their importance, and whose very oddity should be enough to prevent the reader from <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_g3}}">`________(匆匆忙忙对...做出判断)`</b> this singular man.

8.  “I couldn’t say exactly. Some kind of fever. Of course, he never was what you might call fit. He got abscesses under the arms, and they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_h1}}">`________(把他弄死了)`</b>, it seems.”

9.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_i1}}">`________(你别这么说)`</b>!

10.  Tarrou <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_8_j1}}">`________(在他的描述中穿插了一些对话)`</b> overheard in streetcars and in the streets, never adding a comment on them except—this comes somewhat later—in the report of a dialogue concerning a man named Camps. It was a chat between two streetcar conductors.
