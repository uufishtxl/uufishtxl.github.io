1.  Needless to say, I knew that we, too, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_a2}}">`________(有时)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_a1}}">`________(裁决死刑)`</b>.

2.  I learned that I had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_b1}}">`________(促成了某件事)`</b> the deaths of thousands of people; that I'd even brought about their deaths by approving of acts and principles which could only end that way.

3.  But I was different; what I'd come to know struck in my <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_c1}}">`________(喉咙)`</b>.

4.  I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_d1}}">`________(与...共事/联手/合作)`</b> a group of people I then liked, and indeed have never ceased to like.

5.  That also was true <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_e1}}">`________(某种程度上)`</b> -- and maybe I'm not capable of standing fast where that order of truths is concerned.

6.  It seems to me that history has <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_f1}}">`________(证实我的想法)`</b>; today there's a sort of competition who will kill the most.

7.  “I tried all sorts of jobs, and I didn’t do too badly. But my real interest in life was the death penalty; I wanted to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_g1}}">`________(跟某人算账)`</b> that poor blind owl in the dock. So I became an agitator, as they say.

8.  The result is that you've gleaned your ideas about it from books and pictures. A <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_h1}}">`________(绑在柱子上的)`</b>, a blindfolded man, some soilders <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_h2}}">`________(在附近)`</b>. But the real thing isn't a bit like that.

9.  Do you know that, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_i1}}">`________(在这么近的距离)`</b>, the soilders concentrate their fire on the region of the heart and their bullets make a hole into which you could thrust your fist?

10.  Really it would be shockingly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_j1}}">`________(一种不好的体验)`</b> to linger on such details, that's common knowledge.

11.  To which they retorted that the surest way of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_k1}}">`________(认同/遵守/服从法律条文/规章制度)`</b> of the red robes was to leave to them the monopoly of the death penalty.

12.  “I’ve had to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_l1}}">`________(细想/回忆/长时间思考)`</b> my start in life, since for me it really was the start of everything. I’ll get on more quickly now. I came to grips with poverty when I was eighteen, after an easy life till then.

13.  “Have you ever seen a man shot by a firing-squad? No, of course not; the spectators are <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_82_m1}}">`________(精选的/用手挑选的)`</b> and it’s like a private party, you need an invitation. The result is that you’ve gleaned your ideas about it from books and pictures.
