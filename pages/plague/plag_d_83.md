1.  And today I am still trying to find it still trying to understand all those others and not to be the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_a1}}">`________(至死方休的/不共戴天的)`</b> enemy of anyone.

2.  Pending that release, I know I have no <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_b1}}">`________(作用/重要性)`</b> in the world of today; once I’d definitely refused to kill, I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_b2}}">`________(注定让自己永远流放)`</b> that can never end.

3.  After a short silence the doctor <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_c1}}">`________(稍稍伸直了身子)`</b> in his chair and asked if Tarrou had an idea of the path to follow for attaining peace.

4.  Then <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_d1}}">`________(沉默来临)`</b> again.

5.  I'm still <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_e1}}">`________(对...意见一致/对...看法相同，这里是想法一如既往)`</b>.

6.  But that is also why some of us, those who want to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_f1}}">`________(摆脱鼠疫)`</b>, feel such desperate weariness, a weariness from which nothing remains to set us free except death.

7.  That's why I decided to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_g1}}">`________(在[争论中]支持受害者)`</b> in every predicament so as to reduce the damage done.

8.  For many years I've been ashamed, mortally ashamed, of having been, even with the best intentions, even <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_h1}}">`________(间接地)`</b>, a murderer in my turn.

9.  We can’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_i1}}">`________(一举一动)`</b> in this world without the risk of bringing death to somebody.

10.  I know <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_j2}}">`________(明确地/明白无误地)`</b>—yes, Rieux, I can say I <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_j1}}">`________(透彻了解这个世界)`</b>, as you may see—that each of us has the plague within him;

11.  Two ambulances were clanging in the distance. The dispersed shouts they had been hearing <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_k1}}">`________(不时地/断断续续地)`</b> drew together on the outskirts of the town, near the stony hill, and presently there was a sound like a gunshot.

12.  All I maintain is that on this earth there are pestilences and there are victims, and it's up to us, so far as possible, not to join forces with the pestilences. That may sound simple to the point of childishness; I can't judge if it's simple, but I know it's true. You see, I'd heard such quantities of arguments, which very nearly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_83_l1}}">`________(冲昏了我的头脑)`</b>, and turned other people's heads enough to make them approve of murder.
