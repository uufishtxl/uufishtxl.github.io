1.  When he had taken a few <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_a1}}">`________(游泳姿势)`</b> he found that the sea was warm that night with the warmth of autumn seas that borrow from the shore the accumulated heat of the long days of summer.

2.  Once they were on the pier, they saw the sea spread out before them, a gently <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_b1}}">`________(绵延起伏)`</b> of deep-piled velvet, supple and sleek as <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_b2}}">`________(野兽)`</b>.

3.  Neither had said a word, but they were conscious of being perfectly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_c1}}">`________(适应/协调/一致)`</b>, and the memory of this night would be cherished by them both.

4.  When they caught sight of the plague watchman, Rieux guessed that Tarrou, like himself, was thinking that the disease had given them a respite, and this was good, but now they must <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_d1}}">`________(全力以赴/努力工作)`</b> again.

5.  A sudden blaze <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_e1}}">`________(突然出现)`</b> above the place the shouts had come from and, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_e3}}">`________(阻挡/遏制)`</b> the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_e2}}">`________(气流)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_e4}}">`________(一阵喧闹声)`</b> came to their ears.

6.  The blaze died down almost at once, leaving behind it only a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_f1}}">`________(模糊的)`</b> red glow.

7.  The air here <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_g1}}">`________(有着...的臭味)`</b> stale wine and fish. Just before they reached the pier a smell of iodine and seaweed announced the nearness of the sea and they clearly heard the sound of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_g2}}">`________(海浪轻柔地拍打在大石块上)`</b>.

8.  Behind them <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_h1}}">`________(耸立着小镇)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_h2}}">`________(层层叠叠的画面)`</b>.

9.  Before them <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_i1}}">`________(黑暗延伸出去，无边无际)`</b>.

10.  Rieux could feel under his hand the gnarled, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_j1}}">`________(饱受风雨侵蚀的岩面)`</b>, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_j2}}">`________(一种奇怪的幸福感充满着他全身)`</b>. Turning to Tarrou, he caught a glimpse on his friend’s face of the same happiness, a happiness that forgot nothing, not even murder.

11.  The movement of his feet left a foaming wake as he swam steadily ahead, and the water slipped along his arms to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_k1}}">`________(向他的双腿逼近)`</b>.

12.  Rieux turned and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_l1}}">`________(与朋友一起游)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_l2}}">`________(为...定时/控制...的速度)`</b> his stroke to Tarrou’s. But Tarrou was the stronger swimmer and Rieux had to put on speed to keep up with him.

13.  Their energy <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_m1}}">`________(鼓动/激起)`</b> by this <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_m3}}">`________(困境)`</b> the sea had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_m4}}">`________(突然向他们提供/提出/带来)`</b>, both <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_84_m2}}">`________(奋力朝某处去/赶往某处)`</b> more vigorously.
