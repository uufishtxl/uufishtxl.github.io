1.  At noon, Rieux stepped out of his car into the frozen air; he had just caught sight of Grand some distance away, his face <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_a1}}">`________(紧附于/集中精力于)`</b> to a shop-window full of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.crudely}}">`crudely`</b> carved wooden toys.

2.  He <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_b1}}">`________(突然停下来)`</b>.

3.  Tears were steadily flowing down the old fellow’s cheeks, and they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_c1}}">`________(让医生觉得很揪心)`</b>, for he could understand them, and he felt <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_c2}}">`________(因为同情他的泪水也泉涌而出)`</b>.

4.  A picture rose before him of that scene of long ago—the youngster standing in front of another shop-window, like this one dressed for Christmas, and Jeanne turning toward him <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_d1}}">`________(深深地动情)`</b> and saying how happy she was.

5.  The sick man’s lips parted in a curious smile, and a look of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_e1}}">`________(不怀好意)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_e2}}">`________(划过[脸])`</b> the haggard face. “If I pull through, Doctor—hats off!” A moment later he sank into extreme prostration.

6.  Visiting him again some hours later, they found him half sitting up in bed, and Rieux was horrified by the rapid change that had come over his face, ravaged by the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_f1}}">`________(炎症)`</b> of the disease consuming him.

7.  Grand saw the doctor’s <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_g1}}">`________(镜像/倒影)`</b> in the window. Still weeping, he turned and, leaning against the shop-front, watched Rieux approach.

8.  Rieux, too, couldn’t speak; he made a vague, understanding gesture. At this moment <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_h1}}">`________(他对Grand的悲痛感同身受)`</b>, and what filled his breast was the passionate indignation we feel when confronted by the anguish all men share.

9.  Almost roughly Rieux took Grand’s arm and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_i1}}">`________(把他往前拉)`</b>. Grand did not resist and went on muttering broken phrases.

10.  “Oh, Doctor, I know I look <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_j1}}">`________(安静的那一类)`</b>, just like anybody else. But it’s always been a terrible effort only to be—just normal. And now—well, even that’s too much for me.”

11.  Eight words only. Above it, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_86_k1}}">`________(以工整的字迹)`</b>, was the latest version of the famous phrase. “Read it,” Grand whispered.
