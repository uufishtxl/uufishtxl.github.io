1.  All else <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_a1}}">`________(降到次要的地位)`</b>; that daily there were new victims counted for little <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_a2}}">`________(与...相比)`</b> that staggering fact: the weekly total showed a decrease.

2.  Other surprises were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_b1}}">`________(将要发生在某人身上/就要出现在某人身上)`</b> for him. About the same time there was brought to the hospital a girl whose case Rieux diagnosed as hopeless, and he had her sent immediately to the isolation ward.

3.  One of the signs that a return to the golden age of health was secretly awaited was that our fellow citizens, careful though they were not to voice their hope, now began to talk -- in, it is true, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_c1}}">`________(若无其事的语调)`</b> -- of the new order of life that would set in after the plague.

4.  <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_d1}}">`________(表示转折，尽管如此)`</b>, this new development was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_d2}}">`________(成了镇上的热门话题)`</b>, and people began to nurse hopes none the less heartfelt for being <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_d3}}">`________(不便明言的)`</b>.

5.  It was as if the plague had been <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_e1}}">`________(追围堵截)`</b>, and its sudden weakness lent new strength to the blunted weapons so far used against it.

6.  Rieux remarked to Tarrou that her recovery was “against all the rules!” But in the course of the next week four similar cases <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_f1}}">`________(引起了他的注意)`</b>

7.  But in reality behind these mild <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.aspirations}}">`aspirations`</b> lurked wild, extravagant hopes, and often one of us, becoming aware of this, would hastily add that, even <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_g1}}">`________(从最乐观的角度看)`</b>, you couldn’t expect the plague to stop from one day to another.

8.  And in frost-cleansed air the epidemic seemed to lose its virulence, and in each of three consecutive weeks a big drop in the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_h1}}">`________(死亡名册)`</b> was announced.

9.  Thus over a relatively brief period the disease lost practically all the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_i1}}">`________(增加)`</b> piled up over many months.

10.  Only at rare moments did the disease <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_j1}}">`________(振作起来)`</b> and make as it were a blind and fatal leap at three of four patients whose recovery had been expected—a truly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.ill-starred}}">`ill-starred`</b> few, killed off when <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_87_j2}}">`________(希望处于最大)`</b>.
