1.  To tell the truth, these diary notes take a rather curious turn from the date on which the death <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_89_a1}}">`________(报告)`</b> began to drop.

3.  No doubt these families had hopes, but they hoarded them and forbade themselves to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_89_c1}}">`________(凭借/利用)`</b> them before feeling quite sure they were justified.

4.  That night Tarrou, Rieux, Rambert, and their colleagues joined for a while the marching crowds and they, too, felt as if they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_89_d1}}">`________(得意洋洋/飘飘然)`</b>.

Thus the coming liberation had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_89_f3}}">`________(两面性)`</b>, of happiness and tears.

7.  Tarrou conveys to us that the plague had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_89_g1}}">`________(绝不)`</b> lessened his appreciation of the old fellow, who continued equally to interest him after the epidemic had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_89_g2}}">`________(自然而然地发展)`</b>;

8.  Still, in imagination they could already hear, weeks in advance, trains whistling on their way to an outside world that had no limit, and steamers <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.hooting}}">`hooting`</b> as they <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_89_h1}}">`________(出港)`</b> from the harbor across shining seas.
