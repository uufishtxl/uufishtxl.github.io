1.  He noted that there is always <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_a1}}">`________(某个时候)`</b> of the day and of the night when a man’s courage is <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_a2}}">`________(处于最低潮)`</b>, and it was that hour only that he feared.

2.  But Cottard wouldn't <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_b1}}">`________(拒绝接收/拒不答应)`</b> a refusal.

3.  “And very wise they were!” Cottard exclaimed in the same excited tone. “By the way things are going, I should say they’ll have to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_c1}}">`________(收回前言/承认错误)`</b>.”

4.  Cottard nodded. “Yes, that’s quite <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_d1}}">`________(可能发生的/可能的)`</b>; in fact everyone will have to make a fresh start.”

5.  “So that’s that,” Tarrou smiled. “Quite likely things will <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_e1}}">`________(SUCCEED / to happen, end, or develop in a particular way )`</b> all right for you, too—who can say? It’ll be a new life for all of us, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_e2}}">`________(可以说/不妨说、从某种意义上说)`</b>.”

6.  What interested him was knowing whether the whole administration wouldn't be changed, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_f1}}">`________(全包括/统统的)`</b>; whether, for instance, the public services would function as before. Tarrou had to admit he had no <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_f2}}">`________(内部消息)`</b> on the matter; <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_f3}}">`________(他个人的想法/意见/看法)`</b> was that after the upheaval caused by the epidemic, there would be some delay in getting these services under way again.

7.  They were nearing Cottard’s house. He now seemed more cheerful, determined to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_g1}}">`________(对未来抱持乐观的观点)`</b>. Obviously he was picturing the town <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_g2}}">`________(进入一种全新的状态)`</b>, blotting out its past and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_91_g3}}">`________(重新开始)`</b>.

8.  On January 25, the day of the official announcement, Cottard went to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.cover}}">`cover`</b> again. Two days later Tarrou came across him loitering in a side-street.

9.  In <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.noncommittal}}">`noncommittal`</b> tones they informed him that they wanted “some information,” and walked away, unhurrying, in the direction Cottard had taken.
