2.  If you weren't here, I think I'd <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_92_b1}}">`________(擅自决定/自作主张)`</b>.

3.  No man can live on the stretch all the time, with his energy and will-power strained to the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_92_c1}}">`________(崩溃的点)`</b>, and it is a joy to be able to relax at last and loosen nerves and muscles that were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_92_c2}}">`________(为斗争做好准备)`</b> the struggle.

6.  As he was going out he heard Tarrou calling, and turned back. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_92_f1}}">`________(Tarrou的举止有些奇怪)`</b>, as though he were at once trying to keep back what he had to say and forcing himself to say it.
