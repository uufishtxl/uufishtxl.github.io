- Everybody knows that pestilences <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_f1}}">`________([某事经常会]以某种形式发生)`</b> recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_12_f2}}">`________(灾难从天而降，大难临头)`</b>.

-  “It doesn’t matter to me,” Rieux said, “how you phrase it. My point is that we should not act as if <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_17_e1}}">`________(绝无可能发生某事)`</b> that half the population would be wiped out; for then it would be.”

- But the thing that had struck him most about the man was his aloofness, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_17_n1}}">`________(虽然说不上)`</b> his mistrust of everyone he met.

- Being able, thanks to his professional status, to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_27_h1}}">`________(拉关系/走后门)`</b>, he had secured an interview with a high official in the Prefect’s office.

- But he had also <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_30_a1}}">`________(影响/打动)`</b> a wider, non-specialist public with a series of lectures on present-day individualism.

- Father Paneloux had already <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_30_c1}}">`________(取得成功/成名)`</b> with frequent contributions to the Oran Geographical Society; these dealt chiefly with ancient inscriptions, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_30_c2}}">`________(他是这方面的权威)`</b>.

- Patient and watchful, ineluctable as the order of <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_31_h1}}">`________(人生的安排)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_31_h3}}">`________(等待时机/耐心等待/等待更进一步的发展)`</b>. No earthly power, nay, not even—<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_31_h2}}">`________(记住我的话)`</b>—the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.vaunted}}">`vaunted`</b> might of human science can avail you to avert that hand once it is stretched toward you.

- Then Paneloux <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_31_i1}}">`________(挺直了身子)`</b>, took a deep breath, and continued his sermon in a voice that gathered strength as it proceeded.

- <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_35_b4}}">`________(据他所说)`</b>, he had always thought that perseverance would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_35_b1}}">`________(最终成功)`</b>, inevitably, and, as he pointed out, resourcefulness in emergency was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_35_b2}}">`________(对他的胃口/在他的兴趣范围内)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_35_b3}}">`________(不妨说/也可以说)`</b>.

- “The newspapers and the authorities are <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_37_h1}}">`________(与...合作)`</b> the plague. They fancy they’re <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_37_h2}}">`________(打败)`</b> it because a hundred and thirty is a smaller figure than nine hundred and ten.”

- Tarrou pointed out that, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_38_h1}}">`________(这样的话)`</b>, everyone was “under suspicion.” But the manager had his own ideas and was not to be <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_38_h2}}">`________([对某种信念/想法]动摇)`</b> them.

- “In the early days, when they thought this epidemic was much like other epidemics, religion <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_40_f1}}">`________(坚持主张/坚持意图/坚持立场/不让步)`</b>. But once these people realized their instant peril, they gave their thoughts to pleasure.

- “Anyhow, they’ve no choice. But—” Rieux pondered. “But <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_41_i1}}">`________(我可以这么说)`</b> you know that work of this kind may prove fatal to the worker. And I feel I should ask you this; have you weighed the dangers?”

- Thus it was only natural that old Dr. Castel should <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_44_f1}}">`________(坚持不懈/持之以恒地做某事)`</b> with unshaken confidence, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_44_f2}}">`________(不遗余力)`</b>, at making anti-plague serum on the spot with the makeshift equipment at his disposal.

- <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_48_f1}}">`________(表示讲话人所说的事情/想要表达的观点和看法已经被对方知道了)`</b> how commendable that is, a fine example.

- Rieux <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_48_h1}}">`________(紧盯着)`</b> Rambert.

- “Maybe. But I just can’t <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_49_b1}}">`________(承受/容忍)`</b> the thought that it may last on and on, and all the time she’ll be growing older.

- “You’ve no objection to a <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_51_a1}}">`________(一点酒)`</b> of something strong?”

- Let us suppose that these formalities were taking place at the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.auxiliary}}">`auxiliary`</b> hospital of which Dr. Rieux was in charge. This converted school had an exit at the back of the main building. A large storeroom <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_56_d1}}">`________(朝向/面向)`</b> the corridor contained the coffins.

- Then he seemed to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_l1}}">`________(鼓起勇气)`</b> again and when Rambert entered was shouting almost aggressively: "What's more, I'm pretty sure you won't <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_52_l2}}">`________([在鼠疫问题上]取得进展/成果/)`</b>."

- When Rieux <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_e1}}">`________(告诉/告知/通知他)`</b> that he’d like to be <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_e2}}">`________(让他了解最新消息)`</b>, Rambert proposed that he and Tarrou should <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_53_e3}}">`________(联系/寻找他)`</b> one night at the end of the week.

- It would be more correct to say that they were <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_59_c1}}">`________(变消瘦/变衰弱)`</b> emotionally as well as physically.

- But though they could clearly recall the face, the smile and voice of the beloved, and this or that occasion when (as they now <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_59_h1}}">`________(回忆起)`</b>) they had been supremely happy...

- Tarrou <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_61_c1}}">`________([面对攻击/反对等]顶住/坚持住)`</b> better, but the entries in his diary show that while his curiosity had kept its depth, it had lost its diversity.

- ‘In fact, one might go farther; have you ever heard of a man with cancer being killed in an <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_j1}}">`________(车祸)`</b>?’ This theory, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_j2}}">`________(无论如何/无论怎么样)`</b>, keeps Cottard cheerful.

- “And a moment later he added: ‘Say what you like, Tarrou, but let me tell you this: the one way of making people <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_g1}}">`________(相互支持/互相帮助/同心协力)`</b> is to give ’em <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_63_g2}}">`________(一段短暂时间/一阵)`</b> plague. You’ve only got to look around you.’

- Though prices soared inevitably, never had so much money been <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.squandered}}">`squandered`</b>, and while <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_64_a1}}">`________(基本需求/日常必需品)`</b> were often lacking, never had so much been spent on superfluties.

- “Gas is running out,” he said. “We’ll have to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_67_d1}}">`________(在泥泞中费劲地步行)`</b> it tomorrow.”

- “We’ll <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_65_m1}}">`________(约定一个时间)`</b>, you and I. If I don’t turn up, go straight to their place. I’ll give you the address.”


- Some rather <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.jerky}}">`jerky`</b> movements he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_65_f1}}">`________(参加/参与[尤指违法行动])`</b> gave our <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.connoisseurs}}">`connoisseurs`</b> of statecraft an impression of clever, if slightly overdone, effects, intended to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_65_f2}}">`________(使表现出)`</b> the emotion of the words he sang.

- In other manifestations of life God made things easy for us and, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.plag_d_73_c1}}">`________(到目前为止/迄今为止)`</b>, our religion had no merit.
