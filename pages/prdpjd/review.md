**05**

- By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d05_e}}">`________(沾沾自喜、洋洋自得)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d05_e2}}">`________(因为)`</b> some quality or other, real or imaginary.

**08**

- Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d08_d}}">`________(通知家里人要暂时住下来)`</b>, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d08_d2}}">`________(带回来一些衣物)`</b>. 

- The former was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d08_f}}">`________(两种情绪交加)`</b> admiration of the brilliancy which <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d08_f2}}">`________(运动/体力方面的活动)`</b> had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d08_f3}}">`________(特别的事情)`</b>'s justifying her coming so far alone.

- And Jane, who had only been <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d08_g}}">`________(因为害怕引起家里人恐慌或者给他们增添麻烦而克制做某事)`</b>, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.

**12**

- Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d12_b}}">`________(倾听)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d12_b2}}">`________(Darcy和他的同伴之间的对话)`</b>.

**13**

- She often tried to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d13_i}}">`________(挑拨Darcy做某事)`</b> disliking her guest, by talking of their <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d13_i2}}">`________(终将喜结联姻)`</b>, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d13_i3}}">`________(展望着这段姻缘将给他带来的欢乐)`</b>.

**15**

- <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d15_e}}">`________(我的看法很难轻易消除，无论尽了多大努力改变)`</b>.

**16**

- "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d16_a}}">`________(打算做某事)`</b> make us the atonement he thinks <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d16_a2}}">`________(某人应有的权益/应得的事物)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d16_a3}}">`________(这份心意也是难得)`</b>."

**18**

- But Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d18_b}}">`________(对他的表妹不见怪)`</b>, and should never resent her behavior as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.

**20**

- "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d20_b}}">`________(应得的奖励或惩罚)`</b>, but with him I believe it does not often happen.

- But when the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d20_c}}">`________(牧师职位)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d20_c2}}">`________(突然来到/突然出现)`</b>, it was given elsewhere.

**21**

- Among those who are at all <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d21_j}}">`________(那些地位与他旗鼓相当的人)`</b>, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d21_j2}}">`________(他从来都很傲慢)`</b>.

**22**

- I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d22_f}}">`________(被蒙蔽)`</b>, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night, names, facts, everything mentioned <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d22_f2}}">`________(不拘礼节/随随便便)`</b>.

**24**

- <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d24_h}}">`________(让我奉劝你)`</b>, however, as a friend, not to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d24_h2}}">`________(轻信某事)`</b> all his assertions.

**28**

- The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d28_c}}">`________(控制不住感情)`</b>, made Elizabeth so <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d28_c2}}">`________(差点笑出来)`</b> that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued.

**31**

- <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d31_c}}">`________(我对你毫无保留)`</b>.

- But here she did injustice to the <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d32_f}}">`________(性格中的火热炽烈)`</b> and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d32_f2}}">`________(向她屈身[求爱])`</b>.

**34**

- After <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d34_d}}">`________(表达他的歉意)`</b> on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbor, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d34_d2}}">`________(交往)`</b> that he had been so ready to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d34_d3}}">`________(同意/达成一致)`</b> their kind wish of seeing him again at Lougbourn.

- Lady Lucas could <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d34_f}}">`________(必然感到得意[双重否定])`</b> on being able to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d34_f2}}">`________(回敬/报复)`</b> Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married.

**35**

- You do not <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d35_d}}">`________(充分考虑到某事)`</b> difference of situation and temper.

**40**

- Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d40_c}}">`________(断绝来往)`</b>.

**42**

- Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d42_j}}">`________(机会)`</b>.

**47**

- And as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d47_c}}">`________(当真去做某事)`</b> to work to find it out.

## 04

<b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.ductility}}">`ductility`</b>

-   <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.supercilious}}">`supercilious`</b>

- <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d04_f}}">`________(她讨厌做生意)`</b> and to his residence in a small market town, and quitting them both, he had removed with his family from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d04_f2}}">`________(一心一意跟世人讲起文明礼貌来)`</b>.

## 06

- Happiness in a marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does not <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d05_g}}">`________(完全不会带来幸福)`</b>.

## 07

- Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d07_h}}">`________(因为没有男性继承人，而限定继承给了远方亲戚)`</b>, and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d07_h2}}">`________(难以弥补他的不足)`</b>.


## 12

- <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d12_j}}">`________(不过就算情况像你说的那样)`</b>, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d12_j2}}">`________(未给出理由说明其要求是合理的)`</b>.

- The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d12_h}}">`________(一行行字迹整齐)`</b>, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d12_h2}}">`________(符合)`</b> her opinion of each.

## 24

- And I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d24_g}}">`________(勾画我的性格)`</b> at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d24_g2}}">`________(对双方都没好处)`</b>

## 25

- You must therefore allow me to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d25_e}}">`________(遵从我的良心)`</b> on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.

## 28

- The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d28_c}}">`________(控制不住感情)`</b>, made Elizabeth so <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d28_c2}}">`________(差点笑出来)`</b> that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued.


- This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d28_g}}">`________(看不起我)`</b>, and now <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d28_g2}}">`________(我只能做一件事情)`</b> assure you <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d28_g3}}">`________(用最热烈的语言)`</b> of the violence of my affect.

## 36 

- Let me <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d36_a}}">`________(往最好的方向想)`</b>, in the light in which it may be understood.

- Two of the girls had <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d36_c}}">`________(差点就结婚了)`</b>, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d36_c2}}">`________(最后一场空)`</b>.

## 30

- The envelop contained a sheet of elegant, little, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d30_f}}">`________(烫平纸)`</b>, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d30_f2}}">`________(写满了娟秀流畅的字迹)`</b>.

## 32

- She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d32_e}}">`________(不露出任何口风)`</b> of what had passed before any of the family.

## 33

- And if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d33_d}}">`________(放心)`</b> that we shall <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d33_d2}}">`________(不会见怪)`</b>.

## 35

- "You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d35_g}}">`________(愠色)`</b>, "indeed you have no reason."

## 37

- But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d37_f}}">`________(假装)`</b> <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d37_f2}}">`________(提出这一观点)`</b>, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d37_f3}}">`________(对这件事仍然有一份担心)`</b> which convinced her, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d37_f4}}">`________(考虑再三)`</b>, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.

## 39

- They are <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d39_f}}">`________(在人情世故方面年轻没有经验)`</b>, and not yet <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d39_f2}}">`________(乐于接受/愿意考虑)`</b> the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain.

- She made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d39_c}}">`________(整个人变化很大)`</b> that when she went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.

- I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love, for had I really experienced that pure and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d39_d}}">`________(崇高的)`</b> passion, I should at present detest his very name, and <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d39_d2}}">`________(希望他遭受各种各样的灾祸)`</b>.

## 41

- She is <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d41_h}}">`________(和蔼可亲)`</b>, and I doubt not but you will be honored with some portion of her notice when service is over.

- <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d41_f}}">`________(她对于他来说简直是佳偶天成)`</b>.

## 44

- She was perfectly sensible that he never had, but she wished to see whether he would <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d44_g}}">`________(暴露出对...事情的了解)`</b> of what had passed between the Bingley and Jane.

## 45

- Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them. Anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings, and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had, moreover, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d45_a}}">`________(非常讨他的欢心)`</b>.

## 47

-  And, after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d47_a}}">`________(源于)`</b> the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d47_a2}}">`________(这个时节)`</b>.


## 48

- That is an advantage which he must <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d48_a}}">`________(与我分享)`</b>. I am <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d48_a2}}">`________(和我共同拥有达西小姐的监护权)`</b>.

## 53

- But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which, if true, must <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d53_d}}">`________(对他的好感一笔勾销)`</b>, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult to definition.

## 54

- And that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d54_g}}">`________(和多愁善感联系起来)`</b>.

## 66

- Elizabeth here felt herself <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d66_e}}">`________(有必要做某事)`</b> to say something <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d66_e2}}">`________(辩护)`</b> his behavior to Wickham, and therefor gave them to understand, in as <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d66_e3}}">`________(谨慎的/有保留的)`</b> a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d66_e4}}">`________(他的行为完全可以有另外一种截然不同的解释)`</b>.

## 71

She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d71_e}}">`________(未能给她的心灵带来一丝安慰)`</b>, afforded no palliation of her distress.

## 79

- <b data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.answers.d79_j}}">`________(通知一次，也就能通知到所有人)`</b>.
